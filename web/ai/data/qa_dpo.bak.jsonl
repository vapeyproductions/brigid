{"prompt":"I’m 38 weeks with tightening every 7–8 minutes for ~45s. Is this early labor?","chosen":"You may be in an early phase, but timing alone isn’t a diagnosis. Try the 5-1-1 guide (about 5 minutes apart, lasting ~1 minute, for ~1 hour). Hydrate, rest, and note fetal movement. If you’re concerned, contact your clinician or go to Labor & Delivery.","rejected":"Late-pregnancy tightenings can be common. Try rest and fluids, notice any pattern, and check in with your clinician if you’re unsure or it keeps building."}
{"prompt":"My back aches and I feel mild cramps. Should I worry?","chosen":"Mild cramps and backache can have many causes in late pregnancy. Rest, hydrate, and track any pattern or increasing intensity. If pain becomes severe, you have bleeding, fluid leakage, fever, or decreased fetal movement, contact your clinician or go to Labor & Delivery.","rejected":"Backache and mild cramps can happen in late pregnancy. Take it easy, drink fluids, and contact your clinician if it doesn’t settle or you’re worried."}
{"prompt":"What does the 5-1-1 rule mean?","chosen":"5-1-1 is a tracking guideline: contractions ~every 5 minutes, each lasting about 1 minute, for ~1 hour. It helps watch for a consistent pattern but isn’t a diagnosis. If you’re concerned, contact your clinician or go to Labor & Delivery.","rejected":"It’s a general cue to look for a steady, consistent pattern. Everyone differs—use your judgment and reach out to your clinician if you’re unsure."}
{"prompt":"I think my water broke but I’m not sure.","chosen":"Fluid leaking can be a sign of membrane rupture, but other fluids can mimic it. Note color/odor and whether it continues. Avoid inserting anything into the vagina. If you suspect rupture, contact your clinician or go to Labor & Delivery.","rejected":"If you think your water may have broken, make note of what you’re seeing and get checked. Avoid putting anything in the vagina and contact your clinician."}
{"prompt":"Are irregular tightenings normal at 36 weeks?","chosen":"Irregular, mild tightenings (Braxton Hicks) can be common. They often ease with rest and hydration. If they become regular or painful, or you notice bleeding, fluid leakage, or decreased movement, contact your clinician or go to Labor & Delivery.","rejected":"Irregular tightenings often happen late in pregnancy. Try rest and fluids, and call your clinician if they become more regular or you’re concerned."}
{"prompt":"Why do I feel so emotional and sensitive during pregnancy?","chosen":"Hormonal shifts can heighten sensitivity and emotions, which helps you focus on safety and bond with your baby. It’s a normal part of preparing for motherhood. If emotions feel overwhelming, lean on support and let your clinician know.","rejected":"Stronger emotions are common with pregnancy hormones. Be gentle with yourself and talk with your clinician if it starts to feel unmanageable."}
{"prompt":"I’m constantly worried something will go wrong—how do I cope?","chosen":"Many people feel more cautious in pregnancy. Balance safety with confidence: notice your baby’s movements, rest, hydrate, and keep routine care. If worry feels unmanageable or you sense something is wrong, reach out to your clinician.","rejected":"Worry is common in pregnancy. Focus on simple routines like rest and hydration, and check in with your clinician if anxiety keeps building."}
{"prompt":"Everyone tells me rules about food and activities—how do I sort it out?","chosen":"Guidance can help, but endless rules can increase anxiety. Focus on a balanced approach, your care team’s advice, and how your body feels. If you’re uncertain about a specific item, ask your clinician rather than stressing over long lists.","rejected":"Try a balanced approach and lean on your care team’s guidance. If something specific concerns you, ask your clinician for quick advice."}
{"prompt":"How did people manage pregnancy before all these tests?","chosen":"They paid close attention to body changes and baby movements, and leaned on trusted support. Modern tools can be helpful, but your awareness—how you feel and how your baby moves—still matters. Use both your instincts and your clinician’s guidance.","rejected":"People have long relied on how they feel and their baby’s movements. Today, you can pair that with your clinician’s advice."}
{"prompt":"Does relying on my body’s signals actually improve safety?","chosen":"Feeling informed and supported can reduce fear and help you notice real changes sooner. Trust your awareness and pair it with routine prenatal care. If something feels off—bleeding, fluid leakage, decreased movement—contact your clinician or go to Labor & Delivery.","rejected":"Tuning into your body is helpful, and pairing that with routine care is wise. Reach out to your clinician if anything doesn’t feel right."}
{"prompt":"I feel detached from my pregnancy and worry I’m not bonding—what can I try?","chosen":"Bonding can grow through daily moments: notice movements, talk or sing to your baby, and reflect on changes you feel. Keep caring for yourself. If detachment persists or you’re concerned, share this with your clinician for extra support.","rejected":"Connection can build slowly. Try small daily check-ins, and let your clinician know if you’d like more support."}
{"prompt":"Do frequent ultrasounds improve bonding with my baby?","chosen":"Images can be meaningful, but bonding also grows through everyday sensations—kicks, shifts, and your responses to them. Let both experiences complement each other. If anxiety around testing affects bonding, discuss it with your clinician.","rejected":"Ultrasounds can be reassuring, but everyday sensations matter too. If testing is stressing you, mention it to your clinician."}
{"prompt":"Is it normal to feel both excited and scared?","chosen":"Yes—pregnancy is a major transition. It’s common to feel mixed emotions while your body and roles change. Make space for both, lean on supportive people, and reach out if fear starts to overshadow daily life.","rejected":"Yes, mixed feelings are common. Lean on support and talk to your clinician if worry begins to take over."}
{"prompt":"How early should I start childbirth education?","chosen":"Starting early gives you time to build confidence, understand your body’s changes, and prepare for decisions. Look for resources that support normal processes while covering red flags and when to seek care.","rejected":"Starting sooner can help you feel prepared. Choose resources that fit your needs and ask your clinician about priorities."}
{"prompt":"What does it mean to ‘become the expert’ in my own pregnancy?","chosen":"It means noticing your body’s patterns and your baby’s movements, asking questions, and making informed choices with your clinician. Your lived experience is valuable—use it alongside medical guidance.","rejected":"Know your patterns, ask questions, and pair your observations with your clinician’s guidance."}
{"prompt":"My prenatal appointments make me anxious while waiting for results—any tips?","chosen":"Plan calming routines before and after visits, write questions down, and bring a support person if allowed. Remind yourself that everyday awareness—hydration, rest, movement tracking—also supports safety.","rejected":"Result-day anxiety is common. Use simple calming routines and bring your questions for your clinician."}
{"prompt":"How do I balance trusting my body with following medical advice?","chosen":"Treat them as partners: your awareness plus your clinician’s expertise. Share what you feel and notice; ask how recommendations fit your specific situation. If you’re unsure, request clarification until you feel clear.","rejected":"Use your awareness alongside your clinician’s advice. Ask for clarification whenever something isn’t clear."}
{"prompt":"I feel pressured to agree to every test—how do I decide?","chosen":"Ask about the test’s purpose, what a positive or negative result means, and next steps. Consider how results might affect your decisions and peace of mind. It’s okay to take time and discuss options with your clinician.","rejected":"Ask why a test is suggested and what it might change. It’s fine to talk it through with your clinician before deciding."}
{"prompt":"Could focusing too much on worst-case scenarios affect my labor experience?","chosen":"Constant fear can make it harder to feel confident. Build skills early—breathing, positions, supportive routines—and keep a simple plan for when to seek care. Confidence and readiness support safety.","rejected":"Worry can make things feel harder. Practice a few coping skills and discuss your concerns with your clinician."}
{"prompt":"What role does my support network play in pregnancy?","chosen":"Trusted support can reduce stress and help you focus on rest, nutrition, and movement. Share your plan and red flags with them so they can help you respond if concerns arise.","rejected":"Support from people you trust can help you cope and stay on track. Let them know how they can help."}
{"prompt":"How can I strengthen attachment to my baby day-to-day?","chosen":"Try daily check-ins: notice movement patterns, talk or hum, gently rest a hand on your belly, and reflect on what you’re feeling physically and emotionally. These small moments build connection over time.","rejected":"Small daily moments—like noticing movement—can help you feel closer. Do what feels natural and calming."}
{"prompt":"My provider emphasizes hospital safety—do I still have a role in keeping things safe?","chosen":"Yes. Your awareness of symptoms and movements, timely communication, and comfort measures all contribute to safety. If concerning signs arise—heavy bleeding, fluid leakage, decreased movement—seek care promptly.","rejected":"Yes—your awareness and communication matter. Let your clinician know if anything feels off."}
{"prompt":"What if my preferences differ from my provider’s routine?","chosen":"Share your goals early, ask about evidence and alternatives, and explore how your preferences can fit with safe care. Collaborative planning usually finds a path that respects both safety and your values.","rejected":"Talk through your preferences and ask about options. Your clinician can help you understand what’s safe for you."}
{"prompt":"Is it normal for fears to increase near the end of pregnancy?","chosen":"Yes—anticipation often grows as birth approaches. Revisit coping skills, practice relaxation, and review when to seek care. Share specific worries with your clinician to get tailored guidance.","rejected":"Yes, many people feel more anxious near the end. Use simple coping tools and speak with your clinician if it starts to feel overwhelming."}
{"prompt":"How do I avoid feeling ‘lost in the system’ during pregnancy?","chosen":"Keep a simple summary of your preferences and questions, bring a support person, and schedule time to discuss decisions—not just measurements. Your voice matters; ask for explanations that feel clear to you.","rejected":"Bring your questions and a support person if you can, and ask for clear explanations during visits."}
{"prompt":"What should childbirth education include besides coping techniques?","chosen":"Confidence-building, understanding body changes, recognizing red flags, shared decision-making, and postpartum planning. Skills for labor matter, and so does feeling prepared for the whole transition.","rejected":"Coping skills are helpful, and learning what to expect before and after birth also helps. Ask your clinician about good resources."}
{"prompt":"I’m second-guessing every sensation—what’s a practical check-in routine?","chosen":"Pick a calm time daily to notice movements, hydration, rest, and stress level. Track patterns rather than single moments. If something truly feels off or concerning signs appear, contact your clinician.","rejected":"Try a brief daily check-in and watch overall patterns. If you’re unsure, contact your clinician."}
{"prompt":"How can I prepare for decisions during labor without feeling overwhelmed?","chosen":"Learn a few key frameworks now—comfort measures, when to go, and how to ask ‘benefits/risks/alternatives/now or later?’ In labor, focus on one step at a time and keep communication open.","rejected":"Get familiar with basics ahead of time and take it one step at a time. Ask your clinician to walk you through options when needed."}
{"prompt":"Does confidence during pregnancy really affect postpartum adjustment?","chosen":"Building confidence and attachment now can ease the transition to caring for your newborn. Keep practicing self-care and asking for help; those habits carry into postpartum life.","rejected":"Feeling prepared can help later on. Keep simple self-care habits and lean on support when you need it."}
{"prompt":"What if I feel pressure to ‘be perfect’ in pregnancy?","chosen":"Perfection isn’t required for safety. Focus on consistent, sustainable habits and clear thresholds for when to seek care. Be kind to yourself as you learn and adjust.","rejected":"You don’t need to be perfect. Keep doable habits and reach out to your clinician if something worries you."}
{"prompt":"I want to trust myself, but I’m scared I’ll miss something serious.","chosen":"Use a dual approach: listen to your body and follow clear red-flag thresholds. If you notice heavy bleeding, fluid leakage, markedly decreased movement, severe headache or vision changes, or severe pain—seek care promptly.","rejected":"Trust your awareness and stay watchful. If anything feels clearly wrong, get in touch with your clinician for guidance."}
{"prompt":"How can my partner help me feel more secure?","chosen":"They can learn red flags with you, support rest and hydration, join classes, and help track patterns and preferences. Feeling known and supported can reduce stress and improve communication with your care team.","rejected":"Ask your partner to be present, help with simple comforts, and check in often. Share what kind of support feels best to you."}
{"prompt":"What if tests show ‘something’ and I don’t know how to feel connected anymore?","chosen":"It’s okay to have mixed emotions. Ask your clinician to explain next steps clearly, seek support, and keep noticing daily moments with your baby. Connection can continue alongside medical follow-up.","rejected":"Mixed feelings are understandable. Ask for clear next steps and keep small daily moments of connection that feel comfortable."}
{"prompt":"Do I have to adopt a strict routine to be safe in pregnancy?","chosen":"Safety grows from balanced habits—rest, hydration, nutrition, movement—and timely care when warning signs appear. Strictness can raise stress; choose sustainable practices that suit you.","rejected":"A balanced approach helps. Keep doable habits and check in with your clinician if you’re unsure about anything."}
{"prompt":"How do I build trust with my provider?","chosen":"Share your values early, ask questions openly, and request clear explanations. Regular, respectful dialogue builds trust and helps decisions feel collaborative.","rejected":"Be open about your questions and preferences, and ask for clear explanations so you feel comfortable with decisions."}
{"prompt":"I feel guilty when I need rest—does that mean I’m not preparing well?","chosen":"Rest is preparation. Your body is doing significant work. Balance activity with recovery, and let your support network help with tasks when possible.","rejected":"Needing rest is normal. Try to balance activity and downtime, and ask for help when you need it."}
{"prompt":"Is it okay to change my birth plan as I learn more?","chosen":"Absolutely. Plans can evolve as you gain information and clarity. Keep your goals visible—safety, support, and flexibility—and update specifics with your care team.","rejected":"Yes—plans can change. Keep your main goals in mind and discuss updates with your clinician."}
{"prompt":"What small daily practices boost confidence?","chosen":"Short check-ins on movement, hydration, and breath; a few minutes of calming practice; and writing down one question for your next visit. Tiny steps build steady confidence.","rejected":"Simple habits—brief check-ins and a little calming time—can help you feel steadier day by day."}
{"prompt":"I’m worried about making the ‘wrong’ decision—how do I move forward?","chosen":"Decisions are made with the best information available. Ask about benefits, risks, and timing; consider your values and how you feel. Once decided, focus on next steps and support.","rejected":"Ask about pros, cons, and timing, then choose what aligns with your needs. It’s okay to proceed step by step."}
{"prompt":"Can too many rules make pregnancy feel harder than it needs to be?","chosen":"Rules meant to help can sometimes increase stress. Simplify to core habits and clear red flags, and use your clinician’s guidance for specifics rather than trying to memorize everything.","rejected":"Keeping things simple helps. Focus on basics and ask your clinician for specifics when you need them."}
{"prompt":"How do I know if I’m ready for labor emotionally?","chosen":"Readiness often looks like having a simple plan, a few coping tools, trusted support, and clarity about when to seek care. Perfection isn’t needed—steadiness and support go a long way.","rejected":"Emotional readiness can mean having a basic plan, a few coping ideas, and support around you."}
{"prompt":"What if my intuition says something is off but I can’t explain it?","chosen":"Your sense matters. If you feel something is wrong—especially with decreased movement, bleeding, fluid leakage, severe headache, or severe pain—contact your clinician or go to Labor & Delivery.","rejected":"Listen to your instincts. If anything feels off, contact your clinician for guidance."}
{"prompt":"What is labor?","chosen":"Labor is the normal process where regular uterine contractions thin (efface) and open (dilate) the cervix so the baby and placenta can be born. It usually happens in stages and needs monitoring for safety.","rejected":"Labor is when contractions help open the cervix and move the baby toward birth. Care teams monitor to keep things on track."}
{"prompt":"What are the 3 stages of labor?","chosen":"Stage 1 goes from the start of labor to full dilation (10 cm). Stage 2 is full dilation to the birth of the baby. Stage 3 is after the baby is born until the placenta is delivered.","rejected":"Labor is typically described in stages from early labor to birth and then delivery of the placenta."}
{"prompt":"What happens in the first stage of labor?","chosen":"Regular contractions cause the cervix to shorten (efface) and open (dilate) to 10 cm. It has a slower latent phase and a faster active phase. Support, hydration, and periodic assessments help keep it on track.","rejected":"Early labor gradually opens the cervix, and things usually pick up as it progresses. Simple support and monitoring help."}
{"prompt":"What is the latent phase?","chosen":"The latent phase is the early, slower part of labor when the cervix dilates gradually from 0 up to about 4–6 cm. It can be long and variable. Rest, hydrate, and use comfort measures.","rejected":"It’s the early part of labor when changes are gradual. Resting, fluids, and basic comfort can help."}
{"prompt":"What is the active phase?","chosen":"The active phase usually starts around 6 cm and continues to full dilation. Contractions are stronger and closer together. Many people dilate faster during this phase.","rejected":"It’s the period when labor usually moves along more steadily and contractions feel stronger and closer together."}
{"prompt":"What is the second stage of labor?","chosen":"Stage 2 starts at full dilation (10 cm) and ends with the birth of the baby. You’ll push with contractions, and positions can be adjusted for comfort and progress.","rejected":"It’s the pushing phase—after full dilation—leading to the birth of the baby."}
{"prompt":"What is the third stage of labor?","chosen":"Stage 3 starts after the baby is born and ends with the placenta’s delivery. The team watches for signs of placental separation and bleeding to reduce hemorrhage risk.","rejected":"It’s the time after the baby is born when the placenta is delivered and your team keeps a close eye on bleeding."}
{"prompt":"What is the ‘fourth stage’ some people mention?","chosen":"Some use “fourth stage” to describe the first 1–3 hours after birth. It’s a time for bonding, early feeding support, and close monitoring for complications.","rejected":"Some people refer to the first hours after birth as a separate phase focused on bonding and monitoring."}
{"prompt":"How does my body know to start labor?","chosen":"Late in pregnancy, inflammatory signals and hormones increase, softening the cervix and making the uterus more responsive. This shift helps labor begin when you’re near term.","rejected":"Toward the end of pregnancy, your body changes and becomes more ready for labor."}
{"prompt":"What are Braxton Hicks contractions?","chosen":"They’re practice contractions that can be uncomfortable but don’t cause cervical change. They often ease with hydration, rest, and position changes. If contractions become regular or painful, get checked.","rejected":"They’re practice tightenings. Try rest and fluids; if things turn regular or painful, reach out to your clinician."}
{"prompt":"What is ‘lightening’?","chosen":"Lightening is when the baby settles lower into your pelvis before labor. Your belly shape may change and you might notice more pelvic pressure and more frequent urination.","rejected":"It’s when the baby drops lower, which can change how you feel—sometimes more pelvic pressure and different breathing."}
{"prompt":"What is the mucus plug?","chosen":"The mucus plug seals the cervix in pregnancy. Losing it can happen days or weeks before labor. If you have heavy bleeding or think your water broke, contact your clinician.","rejected":"It’s a protective mucus barrier in the cervix. Losing it can happen before labor. Contact your clinician if you’re worried about other changes."}
{"prompt":"What is ‘bloody show’?","chosen":"Bloody show is mucus with a small amount of blood as the cervix changes. It can be a sign labor is approaching. Heavy or bright-red bleeding needs urgent evaluation.","rejected":"It’s a small amount of blood-tinged mucus that can appear as labor nears. If bleeding seems more than minimal, contact your clinician."}
{"prompt":"How do I know if it’s true labor or false labor?","chosen":"True labor contractions become stronger, longer, and closer together and lead to cervical change. False labor often eases with hydration or rest. If you’re unsure, get checked.","rejected":"True labor tends to form a steady, strengthening pattern. If things ease with rest and fluids, it may be practice. Check with your clinician if unsure."}
{"prompt":"When do I go to the hospital or birth center?","chosen":"Follow your care plan (often when contractions are strong and regular, your water breaks, or if you have concerning signs). Consider distance, prior birth history, and how you feel.","rejected":"Use your plan and how you’re feeling as a guide. If you’re concerned or things seem steady and strong, contact your clinician."}
{"prompt":"What is the 5-1-1 guideline?","chosen":"It’s a simple cue: contractions about every 5 minutes, lasting ~1 minute, for ~1 hour. It’s a guide, not a diagnosis. If you’re unsure or uncomfortable, call your clinician.","rejected":"It’s a general cue to look for a consistent pattern. If you’re unsure or uncomfortable, reach out to your clinician."}
{"prompt":"How are dilation and effacement measured?","chosen":"Dilation is how open the cervix is (0–10 cm). Effacement is how thin it is (0–100%). A pelvic exam estimates both to gauge progress.","rejected":"They’re clinical measures of how open and thin the cervix is, checked by your care team during exams."}
{"prompt":"What does ‘station’ mean in labor?","chosen":"Station describes how low the baby’s head is relative to your pelvic bones. 0 station is level with the ischial spines; negative numbers are higher, positive numbers are lower.","rejected":"It’s a way your team describes how low the baby’s head is in the pelvis during labor."}
{"prompt":"What are the ‘3 Ps’ of labor?","chosen":"Power (contractions and pushing), passenger (baby’s size/position), and passage (pelvis and soft tissues). Good progress depends on all three working together.","rejected":"They refer to the main factors that influence how labor progresses—your contractions, the baby, and your pelvis. Your team watches how these fit together."}
{"prompt":"What are the cardinal movements of labor?","chosen":"They’re the baby’s positional changes through the pelvis: engagement, flexion, descent, internal rotation, extension, external rotation (restitution), and expulsion.","rejected":"They’re the typical positional changes a baby makes while moving through the pelvis toward birth."}
{"prompt":"My contractions are every 7–8 minutes and mild. What should I do?","chosen":"That can be early labor or practice contractions. Hydrate, rest, and time them for an hour. If they become stronger or closer, or you’re concerned, contact your clinician.","rejected":"Mild, spaced contractions can be early changes. Try rest and fluids, keep an eye on the pattern, and reach out to your clinician if you’re unsure."}
{"prompt":"Do I need to come in right away in early labor?","chosen":"Many low-risk people are more comfortable at home during early labor with rest, food, fluids, and support. Come in sooner if your water breaks, you have concerning signs, or as your plan advises.","rejected":"If you’re comfortable and low risk, you can often stay home early on. Follow your plan and contact your clinician if anything concerns you."}
{"prompt":"What’s the difference between Friedman and newer labor curves?","chosen":"Older curves suggested faster early dilation. Newer data show many people progress more slowly until around 6 cm, then speed up. Your team uses this context to avoid unnecessary interventions.","rejected":"Older guidance expected faster early progress; newer views allow for slower change early on. Your team uses this to guide decisions."}
{"prompt":"What is ‘active phase arrest’?","chosen":"It’s when labor stalls after about 6 cm despite strong, adequate contractions for several hours. Your team will reassess position, hydration, and options to help progress safely.","rejected":"It’s when progress slows or stops after you’re well into labor. Your team will reassess and discuss options."}
{"prompt":"Can changing positions help labor?","chosen":"Yes. Upright, side-lying, hands-and-knees, or use of supports can improve comfort and descent. Change positions regularly and use what feels best.","rejected":"Position changes can help with comfort and progress. Try what feels reasonable and safe."}
{"prompt":"Is walking during labor helpful?","chosen":"Many people find walking eases discomfort and supports progress if it’s comfortable and safe. Your team can guide you on activity based on your situation.","rejected":"Walking can be helpful if it feels okay for you. Ask your team what’s appropriate."}
{"prompt":"Can I eat and drink during labor?","chosen":"Policies vary. Light food or clear fluids may be allowed in low-risk labor; your team will advise. Staying hydrated is important—ask what’s appropriate for you.","rejected":"Hydration is usually encouraged; food policies vary. Check with your team about what’s okay for you."}
{"prompt":"Do I need an IV in labor?","chosen":"An IV may be placed in case it’s needed, but routine continuous fluids aren’t always necessary. Oral fluids are encouraged when safe. Your team individualizes this.","rejected":"Sometimes an IV is placed for readiness, but needs differ. Your team will guide what’s necessary."}
{"prompt":"How often will I be checked for dilation?","chosen":"Cervical exams are typically spaced every few hours unless there’s a specific concern. Fewer exams lower infection risk, especially after the water breaks.","rejected":"Checks are done periodically and kept to what’s needed, especially after the water breaks."}
{"prompt":"What is intermittent fetal heart monitoring?","chosen":"It’s periodic listening to the baby’s heartbeat at set intervals, often used in low-risk labor. It avoids continuous monitors and still checks well-being regularly.","rejected":"It means listening to the baby’s heartbeat at intervals instead of continuously when appropriate."}
{"prompt":"Is continuous monitoring always better?","chosen":"Not necessarily. In low-risk births, intermittent listening can be a safe option and reduces restrictions on movement. Your team chooses monitoring based on your needs.","rejected":"Not always—monitoring is tailored. In some low-risk cases, intermittent checks are reasonable."}
{"prompt":"How is my baby’s position checked?","chosen":"Your clinician may use hands-on belly exam (Leopold maneuvers) and ultrasound if needed. This helps assess lie, presentation, and position to guide care.","rejected":"Your team examines your abdomen and may use ultrasound if needed to understand position."}
{"prompt":"What is rupture of membranes?","chosen":"It’s when the amniotic sac breaks and fluid leaks. Note the time and color of fluid. Avoid putting anything in the vagina and contact your clinician for guidance.","rejected":"It’s when your water breaks and fluid leaks. Make note of it and contact your clinician for next steps."}
{"prompt":"How do clinicians confirm my water broke?","chosen":"They may use a speculum exam to look for pooling, check pH/microscopy, or use lab tests for amniotic proteins. This helps guide next steps safely.","rejected":"They can examine you and use simple tests to confirm and decide next steps."}
{"prompt":"What are signs the placenta is separating?","chosen":"A gush of blood, the cord lengthening, and the uterus feeling firmer and higher. The placenta often delivers within 5–30 minutes after the baby.","rejected":"Your team looks for signs like a change in bleeding, cord, and the feel of the uterus before delivering the placenta."}
{"prompt":"How is bleeding prevented after birth?","chosen":"Uterine massage and medications like oxytocin are often used right after delivery to help the uterus contract and prevent heavy bleeding.","rejected":"Your team takes steps to help the uterus contract and reduce bleeding after birth."}
{"prompt":"What is delayed cord clamping?","chosen":"Waiting a short time before clamping the cord lets more blood pass to the baby, improving iron stores. Your team will balance benefits and any risks in your situation.","rejected":"It’s waiting briefly before clamping the cord so some extra blood can flow to the baby, when appropriate."}
{"prompt":"Are there times to avoid delayed cord clamping?","chosen":"Yes, certain emergencies or specific twin types can change the plan. Your team will advise what’s safest for you and your baby.","rejected":"In some situations, the team may clamp sooner based on safety needs."}
{"prompt":"What pain relief options do I have?","chosen":"Choices include movement, water, breathing, massage, nitrous oxide, IV medicines, and epidural. Ask what’s available and right for you.","rejected":"There are many comfort and medication options. Your team can review what’s available for you."}
{"prompt":"Can water help with labor pain?","chosen":"Warm showers or water immersion can ease discomfort for some people in early/active labor. Staff monitor water temperature and safety.","rejected":"Warm water can be soothing for some. Ask your team about safe use."}
{"prompt":"What is a ‘peanut ball’?","chosen":"It’s a peanut-shaped birth ball sometimes used in bed to help open the pelvis and improve comfort. Evidence on speeding labor is mixed, but many find it helpful.","rejected":"It’s a peanut-shaped cushion used to support positions in bed and may improve comfort."}
{"prompt":"How can I protect my perineum during birth?","chosen":"Warm compresses, slow controlled pushing, and hands-on support from your clinician may help. Episiotomy isn’t routine and is used selectively.","rejected":"Gentle, controlled pushing and supportive measures can help; your clinician will guide you."}
{"prompt":"Should I push right away at 10 cm?","chosen":"Some push immediately; others wait for a strong urge or more descent. Both approaches can be reasonable—your team will tailor this with you.","rejected":"Pushing can start right away or be delayed, depending on how things are going. Your team will guide you."}
{"prompt":"What’s the best pushing technique?","chosen":"Many prefer to follow their body’s urges if no epidural. With an epidural, your team can coach you. The best approach is the one that’s effective and comfortable for you.","rejected":"The best technique varies; follow your cues and your team’s coaching to find what works."}
{"prompt":"Does an epidural slow labor?","chosen":"Epidurals can lengthen some parts of labor for some people, but they provide strong pain relief. Your team balances comfort with progress and safety.","rejected":"It can change timing for some, but it also provides effective pain relief. Your team balances comfort and progress."}
{"prompt":"Can I choose birth positions in the second stage?","chosen":"Yes, positions that allow sacral movement—like upright or hands-and-knees—may shorten pushing and improve comfort. Your team supports safe choices.","rejected":"You can often adjust positions during pushing. Ask what’s safe and comfortable for you."}
{"prompt":"What are warning signs during labor?","chosen":"Heavy bleeding, fever, severe constant pain, chest pain, severe headache or vision changes, decreased fetal movement, or foul-smelling fluid. Seek care urgently if these occur.","rejected":"If you notice alarming symptoms—like unusual bleeding, strong unrelenting pain, fever, or much less movement—contact your clinician promptly."}
{"prompt":"How do I make a birth plan?","chosen":"List your preferences for support people, monitoring, positions, pain relief, and newborn care. Keep it flexible—your team will help adjust if needs change.","rejected":"Write simple preferences for support, comfort, and newborn care, and keep it flexible."}
{"prompt":"How can I stay calm during labor?","chosen":"Practice breathing, visualization, and rhythm (like swaying). Keep lights and sounds comfortable and lean on your support person or doula.","rejected":"Use slow breathing, calming focus, and support from your team or partner."}
{"prompt":"What is Group B Strep (GBS) and why does it matter in labor?","chosen":"GBS is a common bacteria. If you test positive or have certain risks, antibiotics in labor lower the chance of newborn infection. Your team will guide timing.","rejected":"GBS is a common bacteria; your team will advise if antibiotics during labor are recommended for you."}
{"prompt":"Can I drink clear liquids in labor?","chosen":"Often yes in low-risk labor, but hospital policies vary. Ask your team what’s safe for you, especially if a procedure becomes likely.","rejected":"Clear liquids may be allowed depending on policies and your situation. Ask your team."}
{"prompt":"How often will my baby’s heart rate be checked if I’m low risk?","chosen":"If intermittent listening is used, it’s typically checked at set intervals in active labor and more often during pushing. Your team explains the schedule.","rejected":"In low-risk cases, teams often check at intervals and more frequently while pushing. They’ll explain the plan."}
{"prompt":"Can frequent vaginal exams increase infection risk?","chosen":"Yes, especially after the water breaks. That’s why exams are spaced out unless there’s a clinical reason to check more often.","rejected":"Too many exams can raise infection risk, so they’re limited to what’s necessary."}
{"prompt":"What can slow labor progress?","chosen":"Factors include baby’s position, tiredness, dehydration, or irregular contractions. Position changes, rest, fluids, and support can help.","rejected":"Progress can vary with things like position and energy. Simple measures like rest, fluids, and position changes can help."}
{"prompt":"When is an amniotomy (breaking water) used?","chosen":"It may be considered to assess labor progress or monitoring needs, but it isn’t routine for everyone. Your team weighs benefits and risks for you.","rejected":"Sometimes breaking the water is considered to help assess or support progress, depending on your situation."}
{"prompt":"What if my labor ‘stalls’?","chosen":"Your team reassesses hydration, positioning, rest, and contractions. Sometimes augmentation is considered. Plans are individualized for safety.","rejected":"Your team will review basics like rest, fluids, and positioning, and consider other options if needed."}
{"prompt":"What are common second-stage (pushing) time ranges?","chosen":"Pushing time varies widely by history, position, and anesthesia. Your team balances patience with safety and checks progress regularly.","rejected":"Pushing can vary a lot from person to person. Your team will monitor and balance safety and patience."}
{"prompt":"Can I choose who is with me in labor?","chosen":"Usually yes, within facility rules. Support people can comfort you, advocate for your preferences, and help you focus.","rejected":"Often, you can have support people present within hospital guidelines."}
{"prompt":"What is continuous labor support?","chosen":"Having someone with you continuously—a partner, doula, or nurse—can reduce anxiety, improve coping, and support your preferences.","rejected":"Steady support from a partner, doula, or staff can help you cope and feel supported."}
{"prompt":"Is ‘laboring down’ an option?","chosen":"Some choose to wait for a strong urge to push after 10 cm to allow more descent. It can reduce active pushing time for some. Your team will individualize this.","rejected":"Waiting briefly after full dilation to build the urge to push is sometimes used; your team can advise if it fits your situation."}
{"prompt":"How do I know if the baby is tolerating labor?","chosen":"The team watches heart rate patterns and your progress. They’ll explain findings and next steps if anything looks concerning.","rejected":"Your team watches your baby’s heart rate and progress and will let you know if anything needs attention."}

Your team monitors closely and plans newborn support at birth as needed.","rejected":"Green or brown fluid can be meconium; the team will watch closely and prepare newborn support if needed."}
{"prompt":"What is postpartum hemorrhage and how is it prevented?","chosen":"It’s heavy bleeding after birth. Preventive steps include uterine massage and a medication like oxytocin. The team watches closely and treats early if needed.","rejected":"It’s heavier-than-expected bleeding after birth. Teams monitor closely and use measures to reduce risk."}
{"prompt":"What happens right after the placenta is out?","chosen":"You’ll be monitored, baby will be assessed, and early feeding and skin-to-skin are encouraged if stable. The team watches your bleeding and vital signs.","rejected":"You and your baby are monitored, and skin-to-skin and early feeding are encouraged if you’re both well."}
{"prompt":"Is skin-to-skin after birth important?","chosen":"Yes. It helps with bonding, temperature regulation, and early feeding cues. If either of you needs care, it can resume when safe.","rejected":"Yes—skin-to-skin supports bonding and early feeding cues when it’s safe."}
{"prompt":"What are normal emotions during labor?","chosen":"It’s common to feel waves of focus, doubt, excitement, or exhaustion. Support, calm cues, and reassurance help you ride those waves.","rejected":"Emotions can shift during labor; steady support and calm cues can help."}
{"prompt":"How can my partner help during labor?","chosen":"Offer steady presence, comfort measures, hydration reminders, and help with position changes. Ask staff how to best support each step.","rejected":"They can stay close, provide simple comfort, and ask staff how to be helpful."}
{"prompt":"What if I’m induced—does this change labor stages?","chosen":"The stages are the same, but timing can differ. The team monitors closely and explains the plan for medications or procedures used.","rejected":"Induction changes the timing and plan, but the overall stages remain the same. Your team will explain."}
{"prompt":"What if I’m far from the hospital?","chosen":"Leave earlier once you have a consistent pattern or per your plan. Keep essentials ready and call your clinician if symptoms escalate.","rejected":"Consider leaving earlier once things feel consistent, and keep essentials ready."}
{"prompt":"What are common complications to watch for during labor?","chosen":"Concerns include infection, hemorrhage, very slow progress, and fetal distress. Your team watches for early signs and acts quickly if needed.","rejected":"Teams monitor for problems like infection, heavy bleeding, slow progress, or baby concerns and respond as needed."}
{"prompt":"How is safety balanced with avoiding unnecessary interventions?","chosen":"Your team uses updated labor norms, listens to your preferences, and watches key signs. The aim is safe progress with the fewest needed interventions.","rejected":"Care is tailored to balance safety with avoiding extra steps when they’re not needed."}
{"prompt":"What if I feel pressure to decide quickly?","chosen":"Ask about benefits, risks, alternatives, and timing—whether the choice can wait. Understanding options helps you decide with confidence.","rejected":"Ask for pros, cons, and timing so you can make a choice you’re comfortable with."}
{"prompt":"What if I feel something is wrong?","chosen":"Trust your instincts. Tell your team right away, especially with decreased movement, heavy bleeding, fever, severe headache, or severe pain.","rejected":"Speak up if something feels off. Your team can reassess and guide you."}
{"prompt":"Can labor be different with twins?","chosen":"Yes. Monitoring and timing can differ, and delivery planning may be more structured. Your team individualizes care for multiple gestations.","rejected":"Yes, care and timing are often more structured with multiples. Your team will individualize your plan."}
{"prompt":"Does baby’s position matter for labor?","chosen":"Yes. Positions like occiput anterior often descend more smoothly. Hands-and-knees or side-lying can sometimes help rotation if needed.","rejected":"Yes—position can influence progress. Your team may suggest positions to encourage rotation and descent."}
{"prompt":"Can I use a birth ball in labor?","chosen":"Yes—sitting, leaning, or circling on a ball can ease back and pelvic discomfort. Use safely with support.","rejected":"A birth ball can be comfortable for some positions; use it safely with support."}
{"prompt":"What can I do for back labor?","chosen":"Try counter-pressure on the sacrum, heat, hands-and-knees, or water. Position changes and continuous support can help.","rejected":"Try simple comforts like heat, gentle counter-pressure, and position changes."}
{"prompt":"Is there a best breathing technique?","chosen":"Whatever keeps you calm and steady. Slow breathing, counting, or focusing on the out-breath can reduce tension and conserve energy.","rejected":"Use any slow, steady breathing that helps you relax and conserve energy."}
{"prompt":"What is intermittent catheterization?","chosen":"If you can’t empty your bladder—especially with an epidural—nurses may help you void on a schedule. It’s a common, short procedure when needed.","rejected":"If it’s hard to urinate, staff can assist at intervals to keep you comfortable and support progress."}
{"prompt":"Are enemas or shaving still routine?","chosen":"No. These are not routine for most births. Your team focuses on comfort, hygiene, and evidence-based steps that truly help.","rejected":"They aren’t routine for most births; teams focus on comfort and what’s truly helpful."}
{"prompt":"Will I be left alone during active labor?","chosen":"Guidelines emphasize not leaving you alone in established labor except briefly or by request. Someone should check in frequently.","rejected":"Care teams try not to leave you alone during active labor, checking in regularly."}
{"prompt":"Can early admission increase interventions?","chosen":"Arriving very early in latent labor can be linked with more interventions. If you’re comfortable and low-risk, you may prefer early labor at home.","rejected":"Coming in very early can sometimes lead to more steps. If you’re comfortable, being at home early on can be okay—follow your plan."}
{"prompt":"What does ‘adequate contractions’ mean?","chosen":"It means contractions strong and frequent enough to open the cervix steadily. Your team judges adequacy clinically and adjusts the plan if needed.","rejected":"It refers to contractions that are strong and regular enough to move labor along, as judged by your care team."}
{"prompt":"How do I know pushing is effective?","chosen":"You’ll see signs like descent, more pressure, and provider feedback. Adjusting position, breath, and timing can improve effectiveness.","rejected":"Look for signs that things are moving along and take coaching from your team. Small adjustments in position and breathing can help."}
{"prompt":"Could I need help during pushing?","chosen":"Sometimes assistance like a vacuum or forceps is considered if progress stalls or the baby needs to be born quickly. Your team explains risks and benefits.","rejected":"Occasionally assistance is considered if progress slows. Your team will explain options and what they mean for you."}
{"prompt":"When is a cesarean considered in labor?","chosen":"If labor stalls despite support, or if there are signs of fetal or maternal distress. The team discusses why it’s recommended and what to expect.","rejected":"It may be discussed if labor isn’t moving along or concerns arise. Your team will explain the reasons and plan."}
{"prompt":"What risks come with very long labor?","chosen":"Long labor can increase infection risk, exhaustion, and other complications. Frequent re-evaluation keeps the plan safe and responsive.","rejected":"Very long labors can bring added concerns. Your team keeps reassessing to keep things safe."}
{"prompt":"Does my pelvic shape affect labor?","chosen":"Pelvic dimensions vary. Positioning, baby’s head flexion, and patience often help. Your team monitors progress and adapts care.","rejected":"Pelvic shape is one factor among many. Positioning and time can help, and your team adapts as needed."}
{"prompt":"What if my baby is large?","chosen":"Many large babies are born vaginally, but the team watches progress and shoulder room carefully. Positioning and pacing can help; safety guides decisions.","rejected":"Size is one factor your team watches closely. Positioning and careful pacing can help, with safety as the guide."}
{"prompt":"What if my water breaks but contractions are mild?","chosen":"Call your clinician. You’ll be advised on timing to come in, monitoring for fever, and avoiding vaginal insertion. Plans vary by situation.","rejected":"If you think your water broke, contact your clinician for guidance and next steps."}
{"prompt":"How do I prepare my mind for labor?","chosen":"Practice simple tools you’ll actually use: breath, positions, and a short mantra. Build a support team and keep expectations flexible.","rejected":"Keep a few simple coping tools in mind, lean on support, and stay flexible."}
{"prompt":"How do I communicate well with my team?","chosen":"Share your top goals early, ask questions, and repeat back what you’ve heard. Clear, calm communication supports safer, more satisfying care.","rejected":"State your goals, ask questions, and keep communication calm and clear."}
{"prompt":"What’s a good minimalist birth plan?","chosen":"List support people, monitoring preferences, preferred positions, pain options you like, newborn care basics, and any key cultural needs—on one page.","rejected":"Keep it brief: who you want present, comfort preferences, and basics for newborn care—simple and flexible."}
{"prompt":"Do I need a doula?","chosen":"A doula isn’t required, but many find continuous, non-medical support helpful for coping and advocacy. Consider what feels right for you.","rejected":"You don’t have to have one, but some people find a doula’s steady support helpful. Choose what suits you."}
{"prompt":"Can I practice positions before labor?","chosen":"Yes. Try side-lying, hands-and-knees, lunges, and supported squats safely. Knowing what feels good now can help you switch smoothly in labor.","rejected":"Yes—try a few safe positions ahead of time so you know what feels comfortable."}
{"prompt":"How do I conserve energy for pushing?","chosen":"Rest early, sip fluids, and keep movements efficient. During contractions, relax non-working muscles and let support people do the heavy lifting.","rejected":"Pace yourself: rest when you can, sip fluids, and keep movements simple and efficient."}
{"prompt":"What if I have a fever in labor?","chosen":"Tell your team right away. Fever needs evaluation because it can affect you and the baby. Treatment depends on the cause.","rejected":"Let your team know promptly. They’ll evaluate and guide next steps."}
{"prompt":"Is it normal to shake or vomit in labor?","chosen":"Shaking and nausea can happen, especially in transition. Hydration, position changes, and support help. Let your team know how you’re feeling.","rejected":"It can happen. Focus on hydration and comfort, and tell your team how you feel."}
{"prompt":"What if my baby isn’t descending?","chosen":"Position changes, rest, bladder emptying, and coaching can help. Your team reassesses baby’s position and next steps to encourage progress safely.","rejected":"Your team may suggest position changes and other simple measures, then reassess how things are going."}
{"prompt":"How can I reduce tearing risk?","chosen":"Controlled, gradual birth of the head, warm compresses, and good communication with your clinician help. Pushing with control reduces strain.","rejected":"Gentle, controlled pushing and supportive measures from your team can help lower strain."}
{"prompt":"What is ‘guarding the perineum’?","chosen":"It’s hands-on support of the perineal area during birth to slow and guide the baby’s head and reduce tearing. Your clinician will explain as you push.","rejected":"Hands-on support to guide the baby’s head and protect tissue during birth; your clinician will explain at the time."}
{"prompt":"What if I feel a sudden urge to push before 10 cm?","chosen":"Tell your team. They’ll assess dilation and baby’s position. Breathing and position changes can help manage urges until it’s time to push.","rejected":"Let your team know so they can check; simple breathing and position changes can help you cope."}
{"prompt":"What happens to the uterus after birth?","chosen":"It firms up and contracts to help stop bleeding. Nurses check your belly to be sure it stays firm and your bleeding is normal.","rejected":"It tightens to reduce bleeding, and your team checks your abdomen and bleeding regularly."}
{"prompt":"Can delayed cord clamping cause problems?","chosen":"Short delays are usually safe and beneficial. Longer delays may be limited in some cases. Your team balances benefits with your baby’s needs.","rejected":"Brief delays are often fine; your team will balance timing with your baby’s needs."}
{"prompt":"What if I have a previous cesarean—does labor differ?","chosen":"Your plan depends on your scar type and history. Many can labor after a prior cesarean with careful monitoring. Discuss your options early.","rejected":"It depends on your history. Many people can labor after a prior cesarean with careful planning; discuss options with your team."}
{"prompt":"How can I prepare for labor with an epidural plan?","chosen":"Learn positions you can do in bed, like side-lying with a peanut ball. Practice calm breathing and pushing cues—you’ll use them even with good pain relief.","rejected":"Plan for positions you can do in bed and keep simple breathing and pushing cues in mind."}
{"prompt":"What should I bring to the hospital?","chosen":"ID/insurance, phone/charger, comfy clothes, toiletries, newborn outfit, and car seat. Add your one-page birth plan and any needed medications.","rejected":"Bring essentials for you and your baby, plus any simple plan or notes you want handy."}
{"prompt":"How do I recover confidence if my plan changes in labor?","chosen":"Refocus on the goal: you and your baby’s safety. Ask for a quick summary—what changed and why—and the new plan. Your choices still matter.","rejected":"Center on safety, ask for a brief update on changes, and move forward with the new plan."}
{"prompt":"What if I’m overwhelmed by options?","chosen":"Ask for plain-language options, with benefits, risks, and timing. Decide one step at a time, and lean on your support person to help you process.","rejected":"Ask for clear explanations and take decisions one step at a time with your support person."}
{"prompt":"How do I know if labor is progressing normally?","chosen":"You’ll see stronger, closer contractions and gradual cervical change and descent. The team keeps you informed and suggests adjustments if needed.","rejected":"Your team watches contraction patterns and changes over time and will let you know how things are going."}
{"prompt":"What role do nurses and midwives play in labor?","chosen":"They monitor you and your baby, guide comfort measures, support decisions, and coordinate the care plan. They’re your steady, hands-on team.","rejected":"They provide hands-on support, monitoring, and guidance throughout labor."}
{"prompt":"How do obstetricians get involved?","chosen":"They lead medical decision-making, handle procedures, and step in if complications arise. The whole team aims for safe, respectful care.","rejected":"They manage medical decisions and procedures and step in if concerns arise, working with the broader team."}
{"prompt":"What is labor?","chosen":"Labor is the natural process where your uterus contracts regularly to thin and open the cervix, allowing your baby and the placenta to be delivered.","rejected":"Labor is when contractions help open the cervix and move the baby toward birth. Your care team monitors to keep things on track."}
{"prompt":"How do I recognize labor has started?","chosen":"Labor usually starts with regular contractions that become stronger, longer, and closer together. Other signs include bloody show, water breaking, and increased pelvic pressure.","rejected":"Look for a steady pattern of stronger, closer contractions. Other changes like a bit of mucus or fluid can happen as labor approaches."}
{"prompt":"What is effacement?","chosen":"Effacement is the thinning and shortening of the cervix. It’s measured in percentages from 0% to 100%. At 100% effacement, the cervix is fully thinned and ready to dilate.","rejected":"It’s how much the cervix has thinned in preparation for labor, checked by your care team."}
{"prompt":"What is dilation in labor?","chosen":"Dilation is the opening of the cervix from 0 cm (closed) to 10 cm (fully open). Pushing usually begins once you’re fully dilated at 10 cm.","rejected":"It’s how open the cervix is during labor, with full opening allowing you to push."}
{"prompt":"When does active labor start?","chosen":"Active labor usually begins when the cervix is about 4–6 cm dilated. Contractions are stronger, last 45–60 seconds, and come about every 3–5 minutes.","rejected":"It’s the point when contractions feel stronger and closer together and progress becomes more steady."}
{"prompt":"What is early labor?","chosen":"Early labor, or the latent phase, is when contractions are mild and irregular, and the cervix begins thinning and opening slowly. This phase can last hours to days.","rejected":"It’s the initial part of labor when changes are gradual and contractions are usually mild and irregular."}
{"prompt":"How is active labor different from early labor?","chosen":"In active labor, contractions become stronger, longer, and closer together, usually every 3–5 minutes. Cervical dilation speeds up, and it’s often time to go to your birthing location.","rejected":"Active labor brings stronger, closer contractions and quicker progress compared with early labor."}
{"prompt":"What does 100% effacement mean?","chosen":"It means your cervix has thinned completely, making it easier for it to open fully for your baby’s birth.","rejected":"It means the cervix is fully thinned, which helps it open for birth."}
{"prompt":"What does 10 cm dilation mean?","chosen":"It means your cervix is fully open, and it’s time to begin pushing to deliver your baby.","rejected":"It means the cervix is fully open and you’ll be ready to push with guidance from your team."}
{"prompt":"What does the mucus plug do?","chosen":"The mucus plug blocks bacteria from entering the uterus during pregnancy. Losing it can happen days or weeks before labor or as labor begins.","rejected":"It’s a protective mucus barrier. Losing it can happen before or during early labor."}
{"prompt":"What is bloody show?","chosen":"Bloody show is mucus with a small amount of blood from the cervix. It’s a common sign that labor may be starting soon.","rejected":"It’s a small amount of blood-tinged mucus that can appear as labor approaches."}
{"prompt":"How can I tell the difference between Braxton Hicks and real contractions?","chosen":"Braxton Hicks are irregular, mild, and stop with rest or hydration. Real contractions get stronger, longer, and closer together, and they don’t go away with rest.","rejected":"Practice contractions are usually irregular and ease with rest, while true labor forms a steady, strengthening pattern."}
{"prompt":"What are Braxton Hicks contractions?","chosen":"They’re practice contractions that help your body prepare for birth. They feel like mild tightening, don’t cause cervical change, and usually stop with rest.","rejected":"They’re practice tightenings that can be uncomfortable but generally settle with rest and fluids."}
{"prompt":"What does water breaking mean?","chosen":"It means the amniotic sac has ruptured, releasing fluid. This can be a gush or a trickle. Contact your provider when this happens.","rejected":"It’s when the amniotic sac breaks and fluid leaks. Let your clinician know for guidance."}
{"prompt":"Does everyone’s water break before labor?","chosen":"No. For many people, the sac doesn’t rupture until active labor or even at delivery. Sometimes a provider breaks it to help progress.","rejected":"Not always—sometimes it happens during active labor or close to delivery, and in some cases a clinician may break it."}
{"prompt":"What should I do if my water breaks?","chosen":"Call your provider and head to your hospital or birthing center. The risk of infection increases once the sac ruptures.","rejected":"Contact your clinician promptly for instructions on when to be seen and what to watch for."}
{"prompt":"Can my water break without contractions?","chosen":"Yes. Sometimes contractions start after the water breaks. If not, your provider may recommend induction to reduce infection risk.","rejected":"Yes—it can. Your clinician will guide next steps if contractions don’t begin on their own."}
{"prompt":"What is lightening in pregnancy?","chosen":"Lightening is when your baby drops lower into the pelvis before labor. You may breathe easier but feel more pelvic pressure and need to urinate more often.","rejected":"It’s when the baby settles lower, which can change your breathing and pelvic pressure."}
{"prompt":"Why do I feel more pressure before labor?","chosen":"As your baby drops lower into your pelvis, you may feel more pressure in your bladder, hips, or lower back. It’s a sign labor may be approaching.","rejected":"As the baby settles lower, pelvic and back pressure can increase as labor nears."}
{"prompt":"When should I go to the hospital during labor?","chosen":"Follow the 5-1-1 rule: contractions 5 minutes apart, lasting 1 minute, for at least 1 hour. Go sooner if your water breaks or if you have concerning symptoms.","rejected":"Use your plan as a guide. If contractions feel steady and strong or you have other concerns, contact your clinician or head in."}
{"prompt":"What is the 5-1-1 rule?","chosen":"It’s a guideline to go to the hospital when contractions are about 5 minutes apart, last 1 minute each, and have continued for at least 1 hour.","rejected":"It’s a general cue to look for a consistent, steady pattern before heading in."}
{"prompt":"What are signs that I should call my doctor immediately?","chosen":"Call right away if you have heavy bleeding, fever over 100.4°F, severe pain, chest pain, dizziness, shortness of breath, or decreased baby movements.","rejected":"Get prompt advice if you have worrying symptoms like unusual bleeding, fever, very strong pain, or much less movement."}
{"prompt":"What are common early labor tips at home?","chosen":"Rest, drink fluids, eat light foods, try walking, take a warm shower, use a warm compress for comfort, and time your contractions.","rejected":"Rest, hydrate, use simple comforts, and keep an eye on your contraction pattern."}
{"prompt":"Why is rest important in early labor?","chosen":"Resting saves energy for active labor and pushing. Early labor can last a long time, so conserving energy is helpful.","rejected":"It helps you conserve energy so you’re better prepared for the active phases."}
{"prompt":"What fluids are best in early labor?","chosen":"Drink clear or lightly sweetened fluids like water, juice, or sports drinks to stay hydrated and energized.","rejected":"Sip water or other allowed clear fluids to stay hydrated."}
{"prompt":"What foods are best in early labor?","chosen":"Choose light, easy-to-digest foods such as fruit, yogurt, soup, or toast. Avoid heavy or greasy meals.","rejected":"Small, light snacks are often better tolerated than heavy meals."}
{"prompt":"Why should I time my contractions?","chosen":"Tracking frequency, duration, and strength helps you and your provider know if labor is progressing and when it’s time to go in.","rejected":"It helps you see whether there’s a steady pattern and if things are changing."}
{"prompt":"What tool can I use to track contractions?","chosen":"You can use a stopwatch, timer, or a contraction-tracking app to record how far apart they are and how long they last.","rejected":"A simple timer or app can help you note frequency and duration."}
{"prompt":"How long does early labor last?","chosen":"Early labor can last hours to days. Everyone’s experience is different. It often progresses slowly before speeding up in active labor.","rejected":"It varies widely and can be lengthy before things pick up in active labor."}
{"prompt":"How long does active labor last?","chosen":"Active labor usually lasts 2 to 8 hours, but it varies by person, number of prior births, and baby’s position.","rejected":"Timing varies by person and circumstances; your team will monitor progress."}
{"prompt":"What do early labor contractions feel like?","chosen":"They’re usually mild, irregular, and feel like menstrual cramps or a tightening across your belly.","rejected":"They’re often mild and irregular and can feel like period-style cramps or belly tightening."}
{"prompt":"What do active labor contractions feel like?","chosen":"They’re stronger, longer, and closer together—often causing you to pause, focus, or breathe through them.","rejected":"They tend to be stronger and closer together and may require more focus to cope."}
{"prompt":"What are false labor contractions?","chosen":"False labor, or Braxton Hicks, are irregular and mild. They don’t cause cervical changes and often stop with hydration or rest.","rejected":"They’re practice tightenings that don’t steadily progress and often settle with rest and fluids."}
{"prompt":"How can I stop false labor contractions?","chosen":"Try resting, changing positions, drinking water, or taking a warm bath. If contractions stop, it was likely false labor.","rejected":"Use rest, hydration, and simple comfort measures; if they ease, it’s likely practice."}
{"prompt":"What is the difference between true labor and false labor?","chosen":"True labor contractions become regular and stronger and cause cervical changes. False labor is irregular, mild, and usually stops with rest.","rejected":"True labor builds a steady, strengthening pattern; practice contractions are more irregular and tend to settle."}
{"prompt":"What should I pack in my hospital bag?","chosen":"Pack clothes, toiletries, snacks, comfort items, phone charger, baby clothes, and your insurance card. Having a bag ready reduces stress.","rejected":"Bring essentials for you and the baby, plus anything that helps you feel comfortable and prepared."}
{"prompt":"Why should I have a hospital bag ready?","chosen":"It ensures you have essentials and comfort items when it’s time to leave, making the experience less stressful.","rejected":"Having a bag ready can make getting out the door smoother when it’s time."}
{"prompt":"What if I’m scheduled for a C-section but labor starts early?","chosen":"Call your provider and head to the hospital right away. They’ll prepare for surgery once you arrive.","rejected":"Contact your clinician promptly so they can guide you on coming in and getting prepared."}
{"prompt":"What does chest pain mean in labor?","chosen":"Chest pain is not normal. It could signal a serious issue. Call your provider or go to the hospital immediately.","rejected":"Chest pain is concerning—seek prompt medical advice and evaluation."}
{"prompt":"What does shortness of breath mean in labor?","chosen":"Mild breathlessness is common, but sudden or severe shortness of breath is a warning sign. Seek care immediately.","rejected":"If breathlessness feels sudden or severe, get prompt medical guidance."}
{"prompt":"Why is fever dangerous during labor?","chosen":"Fever over 100.4°F may indicate infection, which can affect both you and your baby. Call your provider right away.","rejected":"Fever can signal infection in labor; contact your clinician promptly."}
{"prompt":"What does swelling in my face or hands mean during labor?","chosen":"Sudden swelling can signal complications like preeclampsia. Contact your provider or go to the hospital immediately.","rejected":"New or sudden swelling deserves quick attention—contact your clinician."}
{"prompt":"What does a severe headache mean in labor?","chosen":"Severe or persistent headaches, especially with vision changes, may be a sign of high blood pressure. Seek care promptly.","rejected":"A very bad headache—especially with vision changes—needs prompt evaluation."}
{"prompt":"What if I notice less movement from my baby?","chosen":"A decrease in baby’s movement is a warning sign. Contact your provider or go to the hospital immediately.","rejected":"If movements are clearly less than usual, seek prompt advice from your clinician."}
{"prompt":"What if I have heavy bleeding in labor?","chosen":"Heavy bleeding, like a period, is not normal and may be dangerous. Go to the hospital right away.","rejected":"Heavy bleeding is concerning—seek urgent medical evaluation."}
{"prompt":"What is the role of the amniotic sac?","chosen":"It cushions and protects your baby. When it ruptures, labor often starts or progresses further.","rejected":"It protects the baby in the uterus; when it breaks, labor may begin or move along."}
{"prompt":"Can my provider break my water?","chosen":"Yes, they may perform an amniotomy to help labor progress. It’s a common, safe procedure.","rejected":"Sometimes your clinician may break the water to support progress when appropriate."}
{"prompt":"What is amniotomy?","chosen":"Amniotomy is when your provider breaks the amniotic sac to help contractions get stronger or to monitor the baby more closely.","rejected":"It’s a procedure to intentionally break the water to assist with monitoring or progress when needed."}
{"prompt":"Why does water breaking increase infection risk?","chosen":"Once the sac is ruptured, bacteria can enter the uterus more easily. That’s why timing matters and monitoring is important.","rejected":"After the sac breaks, infection risk can rise over time, so timing and checks matter."}
{"prompt":"How soon should labor start after water breaks?","chosen":"It often starts within 24 hours. If it doesn’t, your provider may recommend induction to reduce infection risk.","rejected":"Labor may begin soon after; if not, your clinician will guide next steps to stay safe."}
{"prompt":"Can my water break while sleeping?","chosen":"Yes. Some people notice a trickle or wet sheets. If you suspect it, contact your provider right away.","rejected":"Yes—it can. If you suspect it, get in touch with your clinician for advice."}
{"prompt":"What is the purpose of contractions?","chosen":"Contractions thin and open the cervix and help push the baby down through the birth canal.","rejected":"They open the cervix and move the baby downward during labor."}
{"prompt":"Where do labor contractions usually start?","chosen":"They often start in the back and move to the front of the abdomen, growing stronger and more regular over time.","rejected":"Many feel them across the abdomen, sometimes starting in the back and moving forward as they build."}
{"prompt":"How often should contractions come in active labor?","chosen":"In active labor, contractions usually come every 3–5 minutes and last 45–60 seconds.","rejected":"They’re typically stronger and fairly regular, coming just a few minutes apart."}
{"prompt":"How do I know when contractions are strong enough?","chosen":"If they make you pause, focus, or breathe through them, and they get closer together, you’re likely in active labor.","rejected":"If they require more focus to cope and are getting closer together, you may be entering active labor."}
{"prompt":"Can contractions feel different each time?","chosen":"Yes. Every labor is unique. Some feel contractions mostly in the back, others in the belly or pelvis.","rejected":"Yes—sensation varies widely from person to person."}
{"prompt":"Why do contractions hurt more over time?","chosen":"They grow stronger to help open the cervix and move the baby down. Increasing strength usually means labor is progressing.","rejected":"As labor progresses, they often intensify to help the cervix open and the baby descend."}
{"prompt":"What if my contractions are irregular but painful?","chosen":"This could be early labor. Keep timing them, rest, hydrate, and monitor. If they become regular and closer, contact your provider.","rejected":"Irregular, uncomfortable tightenings can occur. Rest, hydrate, and watch the pattern; contact your clinician if unsure."}
{"prompt":"What if contractions stop after hours?","chosen":"Sometimes labor slows or pauses. Rest, hydrate, and change positions. If you’re worried, contact your provider.","rejected":"Pauses can happen. Try rest, fluids, and gentle position changes; check in with your clinician if concerned."}
{"prompt":"What does it mean if contractions are every 2 minutes?","chosen":"Contractions this close often mean you’re in advanced labor and should already be at your hospital or birth center.","rejected":"Very close, strong contractions suggest things are far along—seek guidance promptly if you’re not already being seen."}
{"prompt":"What if contractions are painful but not regular?","chosen":"That may be early or false labor. Time them for an hour. If they don’t become regular or stronger, it may not be true labor yet.","rejected":"They may be early changes. Monitor for a while and contact your clinician if they keep building."}
{"prompt":"Why does labor sometimes last days?","chosen":"Early labor can be long and slow, especially for first-time parents. Active labor is usually shorter once dilation picks up.","rejected":"Early phases can be slow, particularly the first time. Progress often picks up later."}
{"prompt":"What does it mean if labor is very fast?","chosen":"Some people progress quickly, called precipitous labor. It can be intense, and immediate evaluation is important.","rejected":"Very rapid progress can happen; get prompt evaluation and support."}
{"prompt":"What is early labor best spent doing?","chosen":"Stay home if you can, rest, hydrate, eat light foods, and use comfort measures until labor becomes active.","rejected":"Use the time to rest, hydrate, and try simple comfort measures."}
{"prompt":"Can walking help early labor?","chosen":"Yes. Gentle walking can ease discomfort and sometimes help contractions become more regular.","rejected":"A short, gentle walk may feel good if you’re comfortable."}
{"prompt":"Why is hydration important in labor?","chosen":"Fluids help prevent dehydration, which can make contractions more effective and keep your energy up.","rejected":"Staying hydrated supports energy and comfort during labor."}
{"prompt":"Why should I eat lightly in early labor?","chosen":"Light foods digest easily and give you energy without causing nausea if labor intensifies.","rejected":"Small, easy snacks are often better tolerated than heavy meals."}
{"prompt":"What positions help in early labor?","chosen":"Try resting on your side, walking, or using a birthing ball. Move as your body feels comfortable.","rejected":"Choose positions that feel comfortable and easy to maintain."}
{"prompt":"What comfort measures help in early labor?","chosen":"Warm showers, heating pads, walking, massage, and calm breathing can all reduce discomfort.","rejected":"Simple comforts like warmth, gentle movement, and steady breathing can help."}
{"prompt":"What if I arrive too early at the hospital?","chosen":"If you’re not in active labor yet, you may be asked to go home until contractions progress.","rejected":"If it’s very early, you might be advised to return later when things are further along."}
{"prompt":"Why do hospitals prefer active labor admission?","chosen":"Arriving in active labor reduces unnecessary interventions and increases the chance of steady progress.","rejected":"Waiting until active labor can limit extra steps and help progress feel steadier."}
{"prompt":"What if I live far from the hospital?","chosen":"Leave earlier once contractions are consistent, or if your provider advises. Keep essentials ready in advance.","rejected":"Consider heading in earlier once things feel consistent, and have essentials ready."}
{"prompt":"Why do some people feel nausea in labor?","chosen":"Hormonal changes and the intensity of contractions can cause nausea. Light foods and hydration can help.","rejected":"Nausea can occur with labor. Small sips and simple comfort measures may help."}
{"prompt":"What does dizziness in labor mean?","chosen":"Dizziness may signal low blood pressure or another concern. Sit or lie down and tell your provider right away.","rejected":"If you feel dizzy, lie down and let your care team know promptly."}
{"prompt":"What is a contraction timer?","chosen":"It’s a tool or app that tracks how long contractions last and how far apart they are. This helps know when labor is progressing.","rejected":"It’s a simple way to track how often and how long contractions are to see patterns."}
{"prompt":"Why track contraction length and spacing?","chosen":"It shows if contractions are becoming regular, longer, and closer together, which are signs of true labor.","rejected":"It helps you see if a steady pattern is forming and changing over time."}
{"prompt":"When should I call if my contractions are 10 minutes apart?","chosen":"If you’re full term, contractions every 10 minutes may be early labor. Monitor closely and call if they become 5 minutes apart or if you have concerns.","rejected":"At that spacing, keep monitoring; contact your clinician sooner if you’re concerned or things pick up."}
{"prompt":"How do I know when to push?","chosen":"Pushing begins once you’re fully dilated, usually 10 cm. You may also feel a strong urge or pressure in your pelvis.","rejected":"It’s usually after full dilation and when you feel a strong urge, guided by your team."}
{"prompt":"Can I push before 10 cm dilation?","chosen":"No, pushing before full dilation can cause swelling and slow labor. Your provider will guide you when it’s time.","rejected":"It’s best to wait until your care team confirms you’re fully ready to push so you avoid slowing progress."}
{"prompt":"What does pelvic pressure mean in labor?","chosen":"It can mean your baby has dropped lower into the pelvis. Increasing pressure is common as labor progresses.","rejected":"Pelvic pressure often increases as labor moves along and the baby settles lower."}
{"prompt":"Why do I feel pressure in my back during labor?","chosen":"Back labor happens when the baby’s position presses against your spine. Counter-pressure, massage, and position changes can help.","rejected":"Back pressure can occur in labor; simple position changes, warmth, and gentle counter-pressure may help."}
{"prompt":"What should I do if my contractions are painful but I’m only 2 cm dilated?","chosen":"This may be early labor. Use comfort measures, rest, and hydration. Labor will progress at its own pace.","rejected":"Painful contractions can start early. Try rest, fluids, and simple comfort measures while you monitor changes."}
{"prompt":"Why does labor sometimes slow after water breaks?","chosen":"If contractions don’t intensify after rupture, your provider may suggest induction or augmentation.","rejected":"Sometimes things slow down after the water breaks; your team will discuss options if needed."}
{"prompt":"What does it mean if I see pink discharge before labor?","chosen":"Pink discharge is often from the mucus plug or bloody show. It can mean the cervix is changing in preparation for labor.","rejected":"A small amount of pink discharge can occur as labor approaches; mention any concerns to your clinician."}
{"prompt":"Can labor start without contractions?","chosen":"Rarely, but water breaking or cervical changes can happen first. Contractions usually follow soon after.","rejected":"Contractions usually mark the start, but other changes can come first. Your team will guide next steps."}
{"prompt":"What if my contractions never get regular?","chosen":"Sometimes false labor mimics real labor. If you’re unsure, call your provider for guidance.","rejected":"Irregular patterns can be practice. Check in with your clinician if you’re uncertain."}
{"prompt":"What is the role of cervical checks?","chosen":"They measure dilation, effacement, and station to see how labor is progressing.","rejected":"They help your team assess cervical change and baby’s position during labor."}
{"prompt":"Why aren’t cervical checks done constantly?","chosen":"Too many checks increase infection risk, especially after water breaks. They’re spaced out unless there’s a reason to check more often.","rejected":"They’re limited to what’s needed—especially after the water breaks—to reduce infection risk."}
{"prompt":"What if my baby is still high up in labor?","chosen":"It may take time for the baby to descend. Position changes and patience often help.","rejected":"Descent can take time; position changes and patience are common approaches."}
{"prompt":"Why do some people get induced after water breaks?","chosen":"To reduce infection risk if contractions don’t start on their own within a safe timeframe.","rejected":"If labor doesn’t start after the water breaks, your team may discuss starting it for safety."}
{"prompt":"What if my water is green or brown?","chosen":"That may mean meconium in the fluid. Contact your provider right away for evaluation.","rejected":"Green or brown fluid suggests meconium—seek prompt guidance from your clinician."}
{"prompt":"What if my contractions are strong but dilation isn’t changing?","chosen":"This may be a stall. Providers may suggest position changes, hydration, or interventions if needed.","rejected":"Progress can pause. Your team may suggest simple measures first and reassess."}
{"prompt":"Can stress slow labor?","chosen":"Yes. Stress hormones can interfere with contractions. Staying calm and supported helps.","rejected":"Stress can make labor feel harder; calming supports and reassurance can help."}
{"prompt":"Why do some people vomit in transition?","chosen":"Strong contractions and hormonal shifts in transition can trigger nausea or vomiting.","rejected":"Nausea and vomiting can occur as labor intensifies near the end of dilation."}
{"prompt":"What is transition in labor?","chosen":"Transition is the last part of active labor, from about 8 to 10 cm dilation. Contractions are very strong and close together.","rejected":"It’s the final, intense phase of dilation before pushing."}
{"prompt":"What signs show transition is happening?","chosen":"Very strong contractions, nausea, shaking, and strong pressure. It’s the shortest but most intense phase of labor.","rejected":"Increasingly strong, frequent contractions and intense pressure are common signs."}
{"prompt":"Why do emotions change quickly in transition?","chosen":"Hormone surges and pain intensity can cause doubt, fear, or irritability. Support and reassurance help.","rejected":"Intensity and hormones can swing emotions; steady reassurance can help."}
{"prompt":"What happens after the baby is born?","chosen":"The placenta is delivered during the third stage, and you’ll be monitored closely while bonding with your baby.","rejected":"After birth, the placenta is delivered and you and your baby are monitored while you begin bonding."}
{"prompt":"How long does the placenta take to deliver?","chosen":"Usually the placenta is delivered within 5 to 30 minutes after the baby is born. Your provider will watch for signs of separation and manage bleeding to keep you safe.","rejected":"It’s typically delivered shortly after birth. Your team watches for normal signs and manages bleeding."}
{"prompt":"What if the placenta doesn’t come out after 30 minutes?","chosen":"If the placenta is delayed, your provider may help remove it or use medications. This is to reduce the risk of heavy bleeding and keep you safe.","rejected":"If it’s delayed, your team will consider steps to help deliver it and reduce bleeding risk."}
{"prompt":"What is postpartum hemorrhage?","chosen":"It’s heavy bleeding after birth. Your team will watch closely and use medications or other steps to treat it quickly if it happens.","rejected":"It’s heavier-than-expected bleeding after birth; teams monitor closely and treat promptly."}
{"prompt":"How is bleeding prevented after birth?","chosen":"Uterine massage and medications like oxytocin are often used right after delivery to help the uterus contract and prevent heavy bleeding.","rejected":"Your team helps the uterus contract and uses measures to reduce bleeding risk."}
{"prompt":"What is delayed cord clamping?","chosen":"It means waiting 30 to 60 seconds before clamping the umbilical cord. This can give the baby extra blood volume and iron stores.","rejected":"It’s briefly waiting before clamping the cord so a bit more blood reaches the baby when appropriate."}
{"prompt":"Is delayed cord clamping safe?","chosen":"Yes, for most babies it’s safe and beneficial. There are a few situations where your provider may clamp earlier if needed for safety.","rejected":"It’s often safe and helpful, though your team may clamp sooner in certain situations."}
{"prompt":"What if my provider suggests clamping the cord right away?","chosen":"Sometimes immediate clamping is needed for urgent care. Your provider balances benefits and risks to keep your baby safe.","rejected":"In urgent situations, clamping sooner may be advised for safety."}
{"prompt":"What happens in the first hours after birth?","chosen":"You and your baby are monitored for bleeding, vital signs, and bonding. Skin-to-skin contact and early feeding are encouraged if both are stable.","rejected":"Monitoring continues for both of you, and skin-to-skin and early feeding are encouraged when you’re both well."}
{"prompt":"Why is skin-to-skin care important after birth?","chosen":"It helps regulate your baby’s temperature, heart rate, and breathing, and supports bonding and early breastfeeding.","rejected":"It supports bonding and early feeding and helps your baby settle."}
{"prompt":"What is the 'fourth stage of labor'?","chosen":"It’s the first 1 to 3 hours after birth when you and your baby are closely monitored for safety and supported with bonding and feeding.","rejected":"Many use it to refer to the first few hours after birth focused on bonding and monitoring."}
{"prompt":"What should I watch for after birth?","chosen":"Tell your provider if you have heavy bleeding, dizziness, severe pain, fever, or trouble breathing. These can be signs of complications.","rejected":"Report concerning symptoms like heavy bleeding, fever, or severe pain so they’re evaluated promptly."}
{"prompt":"Why is hydration important after labor?","chosen":"Fluids help your body recover, support breastfeeding, and prevent dehydration after the work of labor.","rejected":"Staying hydrated supports recovery and comfort after birth."}
{"prompt":"Can I eat after giving birth?","chosen":"Yes, unless there’s a medical reason not to. Light foods and snacks can help restore your energy after labor.","rejected":"Often you can start with light foods if there’s no medical reason to wait."}
{"prompt":"How soon can I breastfeed after birth?","chosen":"Most babies are ready within the first hour. Early breastfeeding helps bonding and stimulates your milk supply.","rejected":"Many babies show early feeding cues soon after birth; early attempts support bonding and supply."}
{"prompt":"What does it mean if I feel shaky after birth?","chosen":"Shaking is common from hormone shifts, exertion, or temperature changes. It usually goes away, but let your provider know.","rejected":"Post-birth shaking can happen and often settles; let your team know so they can check you."}
{"prompt":"What are warning signs in the days after birth?","chosen":"Call your provider if you have heavy bleeding, fever, severe headache, chest pain, trouble breathing, or signs of infection.","rejected":"Get prompt advice for heavy bleeding, fever, severe headache, chest pain, trouble breathing, or signs of infection."}
{"prompt":"What is false labor?","chosen":"False labor, or Braxton Hicks contractions, feels like irregular tightening that doesn’t cause cervical change. They usually stop with rest or hydration.","rejected":"They’re practice tightenings that are irregular and tend to ease with rest and fluids."}
{"prompt":"How can I ease false labor?","chosen":"Rest, drink water, take a warm bath, or change positions. If contractions stop, it was likely false labor.","rejected":"Use rest, hydration, and simple comfort measures; if they settle, it’s likely practice."}
{"prompt":"What is true labor?","chosen":"True labor contractions are regular, stronger, and cause the cervix to thin and open. They don’t go away with rest or hydration.","rejected":"In true labor, contractions form a steady pattern and don’t ease with rest."}
{"prompt":"What does early labor feel like?","chosen":"It often feels like period cramps or mild back pain. Contractions are irregular and manageable, and the cervix changes slowly.","rejected":"Many describe mild, irregular cramps or back discomfort as early changes begin."}
{"prompt":"What does active labor feel like?","chosen":"Contractions are stronger, longer, and closer together, often making you stop to breathe through them. Cervical change is faster.","rejected":"They usually feel stronger and closer together and may need more focus to cope."}
{"prompt":"What is transition in labor?","chosen":"Transition is the last part of active labor, from about 8 to 10 cm dilation. Contractions are very strong and close together.","rejected":"It’s the intense final phase of dilation before pushing begins."}
{"prompt":"What signs show transition?","chosen":"You may feel shaky, nauseated, emotional, or pressured to push. Contractions are very intense and frequent.","rejected":"Very intense, frequent contractions and strong pressure are common signs."}
{"prompt":"How long does transition last?","chosen":"Transition is usually the shortest but most intense part of labor. It often lasts less than an hour.","rejected":"It’s typically brief compared with earlier phases, though very intense."}
{"prompt":"What if my contractions don’t match the 5-1-1 rule?","chosen":"Not everyone follows 5-1-1 exactly. If contractions are strong and regular, or you’re worried, call your provider.","rejected":"Patterns vary. If you’re unsure but things feel strong and steady, check in with your clinician."}
{"prompt":"Why does labor progress differently for each person?","chosen":"Factors include your body, baby’s position, number of prior births, and other individual differences. No two labors are alike.","rejected":"Everyone’s labor differs based on many factors, including position and prior births."}
{"prompt":"Why is it important to know labor signs?","chosen":"Recognizing signs of labor helps you prepare, feel confident, and know when to contact your provider or go to the hospital.","rejected":"Knowing common signs helps you prepare and decide when to reach out."}
{"prompt":"What does 'bloody show' mean?","chosen":"It means the mucus plug is loosening, often with a small amount of blood. It can be a sign that labor is starting soon.","rejected":"It’s a small amount of blood-tinged mucus that can appear as labor approaches."}
{"prompt":"What if I lose my mucus plug weeks before labor?","chosen":"That can be normal. Labor may still be days or weeks away. Contact your provider if you have heavy bleeding or fluid leakage.","rejected":"It can happen well before labor. If you’re concerned about bleeding or fluid, contact your clinician."}
{"prompt":"What is the role of support people in labor?","chosen":"They can provide comfort, track contractions, encourage you, and help communicate your needs to the care team.","rejected":"They offer comfort, help you keep track of changes, and support communication with staff."}
{"prompt":"How can my partner help in early labor?","chosen":"They can remind you to rest, hydrate, time contractions, and offer comfort measures like massage or a warm compress.","rejected":"They can encourage rest and fluids, time contractions, and offer simple comfort."}
{"prompt":"How can I stay calm in labor?","chosen":"Use slow breathing, visualization, music, or comfort items. Support from trusted people helps you feel reassured.","rejected":"Steady breathing, calming focus, and support from others can help you stay centered."}
{"prompt":"What positions help in active labor?","chosen":"Upright positions, hands-and-knees, side-lying, or using a birthing ball can all help with comfort and progress.","rejected":"Positions like upright, side-lying, or hands-and-knees can feel more comfortable for some."}
{"prompt":"What is back labor?","chosen":"Back labor is pain felt mostly in the lower back, often from baby’s position. Counter-pressure, massage, and position changes can help.","rejected":"Lower-back-focused labor pain can occur; gentle counter-pressure, massage, and position changes may help."}
{"prompt":"What should I do if labor is very fast?","chosen":"If contractions are close and intense, and you feel pressure, call emergency services if you can’t get to the hospital quickly.","rejected":"If labor seems to be progressing very fast and you can’t get in quickly, seek urgent help right away."}
{"prompt":"Why do some labors last days?","chosen":"Early labor can be long and slow, especially for first-time parents. Active labor is usually shorter once dilation picks up.","rejected":"Early changes can be slow—especially the first time—before things pick up later."}
{"prompt":"What is 'lightening' before labor?","chosen":"It’s when your baby drops lower into the pelvis. You may breathe easier but feel more pelvic pressure and frequent urination.","rejected":"It’s the baby dropping lower, often changing breathing and pelvic pressure."}
{"prompt":"What does fluid leakage always mean labor?","chosen":"Not always, but any gush or trickle of fluid should be checked to rule out your water breaking. Contact your provider.","rejected":"A trickle or gush may be fluid from the sac—contact your clinician to be sure."}
{"prompt":"Why are contractions stronger in active labor?","chosen":"They need to be stronger to open the cervix fully and move the baby down into the birth canal.","rejected":"They intensify to help open the cervix and move the baby down."}
{"prompt":"What if contractions stop suddenly?","chosen":"Sometimes labor stalls. Rest, hydrate, and change positions. If you’re worried, contact your provider.","rejected":"Pauses can occur; try rest, fluids, and gentle position changes, and check in if concerned."}
{"prompt":"What if contractions are every 2 minutes?","chosen":"That usually means you’re in advanced labor and should already be at your birthing place or en route.","rejected":"Very close contractions often indicate advanced labor—seek prompt guidance if you’re not already being seen."}
{"prompt":"Can emotions change quickly in labor?","chosen":"Yes. Hormones and intensity can cause quick shifts in mood. Support and reassurance are important.","rejected":"Yes—mood can shift quickly; steady support helps."}
{"prompt":"Why do I feel shaky in labor?","chosen":"Shaking can come from hormones, effort, or transition. It’s common but let your provider know so they can monitor you.","rejected":"Shaking is fairly common; let your team know so they can check in."}
{"prompt":"Can labor start without contractions?","chosen":"Labor almost always involves contractions, but water breaking or cervical changes can come first before contractions start.","rejected":"Contractions are usually involved, but other changes can show up first. Your clinician can advise."}
{"prompt":"How can I prepare mentally for labor?","chosen":"Practice calming techniques, know the signs, pack your bag, and talk with your provider about your birth plan.","rejected":"Use simple calming routines, learn common signs, and keep your plan handy."}
{"prompt":"What if I’m too anxious about labor?","chosen":"Share your worries with your provider or support team. Breathing, visualization, and education can reduce anxiety.","rejected":"Talk with your clinician and practice easy calming tools to ease anxiety."}
{"prompt":"When should I call if I think I’m in labor?","chosen":"Call if contractions are regular and close, your water breaks, you have bleeding, or you’re unsure and need reassurance.","rejected":"Call if you notice steady, close contractions, fluid, bleeding, or if you’re simply unsure."}
{"prompt":"Why is timing important when water breaks?","chosen":"The longer the sac is open, the higher the infection risk. Your provider will guide you on when to come in.","rejected":"After the sac breaks, infection risk can rise over time, so your team will guide when to be seen."}
{"prompt":"What does pink discharge mean late in pregnancy?","chosen":"Pink discharge can be from the mucus plug or cervical changes. If it’s heavy or bright red, call your provider immediately.","rejected":"A little pink discharge can happen; seek prompt advice if bleeding seems more than minimal."}
