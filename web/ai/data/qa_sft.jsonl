{"prompt": "I’m 38 weeks with tightening every 7–8 minutes for ~45s. Is this early labor?", "response": "You may be in an early phase, but timing alone isn’t a diagnosis. Try the 5-1-1 guide (about 5 minutes apart, lasting ~1 minute, for ~1 hour). Hydrate, rest, and note fetal movement. If anything feels off or worsens, contact your clinician.", "risk": "medium"}
{"prompt": "My back aches and I feel mild cramps. Should I worry?", "response": "Mild cramps and backache can have many causes in late pregnancy. Rest, hydrate, and track any pattern or increasing intensity. If pain becomes severe, you have bleeding, fluid leakage, fever, or decreased fetal movement, contact your clinician or go to Labor & Delivery. If anything feels off or worsens, contact your clinician.", "risk": "medium"}
{"prompt": "What does the 5-1-1 rule mean?", "response": "5-1-1 is a tracking guideline: contractions ~every 5 minutes, each lasting about 1 minute, for ~1 hour. It helps watch for a consistent pattern but isn’t a diagnosis. If anything feels off or worsens, contact your clinician.", "risk": "medium"}
{"prompt": "I think my water broke but I’m not sure.", "response": "Fluid leaking can be a sign of membrane rupture, but other fluids can mimic it. Note color/odor and whether it continues. Avoid inserting anything into the vagina. If you suspect rupture, contact your clinician or go to Labor & Delivery.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "Are irregular tightenings normal at 36 weeks?", "response": "Irregular, mild tightenings (Braxton Hicks) can be common. They often ease with rest and hydration. If they become regular or painful, or you notice bleeding, fluid leakage, or decreased movement, contact your clinician or go to Labor & Delivery. If anything feels off or worsens, contact your clinician.", "risk": "medium"}
{"prompt": "Why do I feel so emotional and sensitive during pregnancy?", "response": "Hormonal shifts can heighten sensitivity and emotions, which helps you focus on safety and bond with your baby.

If worry feels unmanageable or you sense something is wrong, reach out to your clinician.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "Everyone tells me rules about food and activities—how do I sort it out?", "response": "Guidance can help, but endless rules can increase anxiety. Focus on a balanced approach, your care team’s advice, and how your body feels. If you’re uncertain about a specific item, ask your clinician rather than stressing over long lists.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "How did people manage pregnancy before all these tests?", "response": "They paid close attention to body changes and baby movements, and leaned on trusted support. Modern tools can be helpful, but your awareness—how you feel and how your baby moves—still matters. Use both your instincts and your clinician’s guidance.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "Does relying on my body’s signals actually improve safety?", "response": "Feeling informed and supported can reduce fear and help you notice real changes sooner. Trust your awareness and pair it with routine prenatal care. If something feels off—bleeding, fluid leakage, decreased movement—contact your clinician or go to Labor & Delivery.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "I feel detached from my pregnancy and worry I’m not bonding—what can I try?", "response": "Bonding can grow through daily moments: notice movements, talk or sing to your baby, and reflect on changes you feel. Keep caring for yourself. If detachment persists or you’re concerned, share this with your clinician for extra support.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "Do frequent ultrasounds improve bonding with my baby?", "response": "Images can be meaningful, but bonding also grows through everyday sensations—kicks, shifts, and your responses to them. Let both experiences complement each other. If anxiety around testing affects bonding, discuss it with your clinician.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "Is it normal to feel both excited and scared?", "response": "Yes—pregnancy is a major transition. It’s common to feel mixed emotions while your body and roles change. Make space for both, lean on supportive people, and reach out if fear starts to overshadow daily life.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "How early should I start childbirth education?", "response": "Starting early gives you time to build confidence, understand your body’s changes, and prepare for decisions. Look for resources that support normal processes while covering red flags and when to seek care.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What does it mean to ‘become the expert’ in my own pregnancy?", "response": "It means noticing your body’s patterns and your baby’s movements, asking questions, and making informed choices with your clinician. Your lived experience is valuable—use it alongside medical guidance.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "My prenatal appointments make me anxious while waiting for results—any tips?", "response": "Plan calming routines before and after visits, write questions down, and bring a support person if allowed. Remind yourself that everyday awareness—hydration, rest, movement tracking—also supports safety.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "How do I balance trusting my body with following medical advice?", "response": "Treat them as partners: your awareness plus your clinician’s expertise. Share what you feel and notice; ask how recommendations fit your specific situation. If you’re unsure, request clarification until you feel clear.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "I feel pressured to agree to every test—how do I decide?", "response": "Ask about the test’s purpose, what a positive or negative result means, and next steps. Consider how results might affect your decisions and peace of mind. It’s okay to take time and discuss options with your clinician.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "Could focusing too much on worst-case scenarios affect my labor experience?", "response": "Constant fear can make it harder to feel confident. Build skills early—breathing, positions, supportive routines—and keep a simple plan for when to seek care. Confidence and readiness support safety.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What role does my support network play in pregnancy?", "response": "Trusted support can reduce stress and help you focus on rest, nutrition, and movement. Share your plan and red flags with them so they can help you respond if concerns arise.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "How can I strengthen attachment to my baby day-to-day?", "response": "Try daily check-ins: notice movement patterns, talk or hum, gently rest a hand on your belly, and reflect on what you’re feeling physically and emotionally. These small moments build connection over time.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "My provider emphasizes hospital safety—do I still have a role in keeping things safe?", "response": "Yes. Your awareness of symptoms and movements, timely communication, and comfort measures all contribute to safety. If concerning signs arise—heavy bleeding, fluid leakage, decreased movement—seek care promptly.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What if my preferences differ from my provider’s routine?", "response": "Share your goals early, ask about evidence and alternatives, and explore how your preferences can fit with safe care. Collaborative planning usually finds a path that respects both safety and your values.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "Is it normal for fears to increase near the end of pregnancy?", "response": "Yes—anticipation often grows as birth approaches. Revisit coping skills, practice relaxation, and review when to seek care. Share specific worries with your clinician to get tailored guidance.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "How do I avoid feeling ‘lost in the system’ during pregnancy?", "response": "Keep a simple summary of your preferences and questions, bring a support person, and schedule time to discuss decisions—not just measurements. Your voice matters; ask for explanations that feel clear to you.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What should childbirth education include besides coping techniques?", "response": "Confidence-building, understanding body changes, recognizing red flags, shared decision-making, and postpartum planning. Skills for labor matter, and so does feeling prepared for the whole transition.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "I’m second-guessing every sensation—what’s a practical check-in routine?", "response": "Pick a calm time daily to notice movements, hydration, rest, and stress level. Track patterns rather than single moments. If something truly feels off or concerning signs appear, contact your clinician.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "How can I prepare for decisions during labor without feeling overwhelmed?", "response": "Learn a few key frameworks now—comfort measures, when to go, and how to ask ‘benefits/risks/alternatives/now or later?’ In labor, focus on one step at a time and keep communication open.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "Does confidence during pregnancy really affect postpartum adjustment?", "response": "Building confidence and attachment now can ease the transition to caring for your newborn. Keep practicing self-care and asking for help; those habits carry into postpartum life.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What if I feel pressure to ‘be perfect’ in pregnancy?", "response": "Perfection isn’t required for safety. Focus on consistent, sustainable habits and clear thresholds for when to seek care. Be kind to yourself as you learn and adjust.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "I want to trust myself, but I’m scared I’ll miss something serious.", "response": "Use a dual approach: listen to your body and follow clear red-flag thresholds. If you notice heavy bleeding, fluid leakage, markedly decreased movement, severe headache or vision changes, or severe pain—seek care promptly.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "How can my partner help me feel more secure?", "response": "They can learn red flags with you, support rest and hydration, join classes, and help track patterns and preferences. Feeling known and supported can reduce stress and improve communication with your care team.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What if tests show ‘something’ and I don’t know how to feel connected anymore?", "response": "It’s okay to have mixed emotions. Ask your clinician to explain next steps clearly, seek support, and keep noticing daily moments with your baby. Connection can continue alongside medical follow-up.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "Do I have to adopt a strict routine to be safe in pregnancy?", "response": "Safety grows from balanced habits—rest, hydration, nutrition, movement—and timely care when warning signs appear. Strictness can raise stress; choose sustainable practices that suit you.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "How do I build trust with my provider?", "response": "Share your values early, ask questions openly, and request clear explanations. Regular, respectful dialogue builds trust and helps decisions feel collaborative.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "I feel guilty when I need rest—does that mean I’m not preparing well?", "response": "Rest is preparation. Your body is doing significant work. Balance activity with recovery, and let your support network help with tasks when possible.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "Is it okay to change my birth plan as I learn more?", "response": "Absolutely. Plans can evolve as you gain information and clarity. Keep your goals visible—safety, support, and flexibility—and update specifics with your care team.", "risk": "low"}

{"prompt": "Can too many rules make pregnancy feel harder than it needs to be?", "response": "Rules meant to help can sometimes increase stress. Simplify to core habits and clear red flags, and use your clinician’s guidance for specifics rather than trying to memorize everything.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "How do I know if I’m ready for labor emotionally?", "response": "Readiness often looks like having a simple plan, a few coping tools, trusted support, and clarity about when to seek care. Perfection isn’t needed—steadiness and support go a long way.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What if my intuition says something is off but I can’t explain it?", "response": "Your sense matters. If you feel something is wrong—especially with decreased movement, bleeding, fluid leakage, severe headache, or severe pain—contact your clinician or go to Labor & Delivery.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What is labor?", "response": "Labor is the normal process where regular uterine contractions thin (efface) and open (dilate) the cervix so the baby and placenta can be born. It usually happens in stages and needs monitoring for safety.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What are the 3 stages of labor?", "response": "Stage 1 goes from the start of labor to full dilation (10 cm). Stage 2 is full dilation to the birth of the baby. Stage 3 is after the baby is born until the placenta is delivered.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What happens in the first stage of labor?", "response": "Regular contractions cause the cervix to shorten (efface) and open (dilate) to 10 cm. It has a slower latent phase and a faster active phase. Support, hydration, and periodic assessments help keep it on track.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What is the latent phase?", "response": "The latent phase is the early, slower part of labor when the cervix dilates gradually from 0 up to about 4–6 cm. It can be long and variable. Rest, hydrate, and use comfort measures.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What is the active phase?", "response": "The active phase usually starts around 6 cm and continues to full dilation. Contractions are stronger and closer together. Many people dilate faster during this phase.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What is the second stage of labor?", "response": "Stage 2 starts at full dilation (10 cm) and ends with the birth of the baby. You’ll push with contractions, and positions can be adjusted for comfort and progress.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What is the third stage of labor?", "response": "Stage 3 starts after the baby is born and ends with the placenta’s delivery. The team watches for signs of placental separation and bleeding to reduce hemorrhage risk.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What is the ‘fourth stage’ some people mention?", "response": "Some use “fourth stage” to describe the first 1–3 hours after birth. It’s a time for bonding, early feeding support, and close monitoring for complications.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "How does my body know to start labor?", "response": "Late in pregnancy, inflammatory signals and hormones increase, softening the cervix and making the uterus more responsive. This shift helps labor begin when you’re near term.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What are Braxton Hicks contractions?", "response": "They’re practice contractions that can be uncomfortable but don’t cause cervical change. They often ease with hydration, rest, and position changes. If contractions become regular or painful, get checked. If anything feels off or worsens, contact your clinician.", "risk": "medium"}
{"prompt": "What is ‘lightening’?", "response": "Lightening is when the baby settles lower into your pelvis before labor. Your belly shape may change and you might notice more pelvic pressure and more frequent urination.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What is the mucus plug?", "response": "The mucus plug seals the cervix in pregnancy. Losing it can happen days or weeks before labor. If you have heavy bleeding or think your water broke, contact your clinician.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What is ‘bloody show’?", "response": "Bloody show is mucus with a small amount of blood as the cervix changes. It can be a sign labor is approaching. Heavy or bright-red bleeding needs urgent evaluation.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "How do I know if it’s true labor or false labor?", "response": "True labor contractions become stronger, longer, and closer together and lead to cervical change. False labor often eases with hydration or rest. If you’re unsure, get checked.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "When do I go to the hospital or birth center?", "response": "Follow your care plan (often when contractions are strong and regular, your water breaks, or if you have concerning signs). Consider distance, prior birth history, and how you feel.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What is the 5-1-1 guideline?", "response": "It’s a simple cue: contractions about every 5 minutes, lasting ~1 minute, for ~1 hour. It’s a guide, not a diagnosis. If you’re unsure or uncomfortable, call your clinician. If anything feels off or worsens, contact your clinician.", "risk": "medium"}
{"prompt": "How are dilation and effacement measured?", "response": "Dilation is how open the cervix is (0–10 cm). Effacement is how thin it is (0–100%). A pelvic exam estimates both to gauge progress.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What does ‘station’ mean in labor?", "response": "Station describes how low the baby’s head is relative to your pelvic bones. 0 station is level with the ischial spines; negative numbers are higher, positive numbers are lower.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What are the ‘3 Ps’ of labor?", "response": "Power (contractions and pushing), passenger (baby’s size/position), and passage (pelvis and soft tissues). Good progress depends on all three working together.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What are the cardinal movements of labor?", "response": "They’re the baby’s positional changes through the pelvis: engagement, flexion, descent, internal rotation, extension, external rotation (restitution), and expulsion.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "My contractions are every 7–8 minutes and mild. What should I do?", "response": "That can be early labor or practice contractions. Hydrate, rest, and time them for an hour. If they become stronger or closer, or you’re concerned, contact your clinician. If anything feels off or worsens, contact your clinician.", "risk": "medium"}
{"prompt": "Do I need to come in right away in early labor?", "response": "Many low-risk people are more comfortable at home during early labor with rest, food, fluids, and support. Come in sooner if your water breaks, you have concerning signs, or as your plan advises.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What’s the difference between Friedman and newer labor curves?", "response": "Older curves suggested faster early dilation. Newer data show many people progress more slowly until around 6 cm, then speed up. Your team uses this context to avoid unnecessary interventions.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What is ‘active phase arrest’?", "response": "It’s when labor stalls after about 6 cm despite strong, adequate contractions for several hours. Your team will reassess position, hydration, and options to help progress safely.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "Can changing positions help labor?", "response": "Yes. Upright, side-lying, hands-and-knees, or use of supports can improve comfort and descent. Change positions regularly and use what feels best.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "Is walking during labor helpful?", "response": "Many people find walking eases discomfort and supports progress if it’s comfortable and safe. Your team can guide you on activity based on your situation.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "Can I eat and drink during labor?", "response": "Policies vary. Light food or clear fluids may be allowed in low-risk labor; your team will advise. Staying hydrated is important—ask what’s appropriate for you.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "Do I need an IV in labor?", "response": "An IV may be placed in case it’s needed, but routine continuous fluids aren’t always necessary. Oral fluids are encouraged when safe. Your team individualizes this.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "How often will I be checked for dilation?", "response": "Cervical exams are typically spaced every few hours unless there’s a specific concern. Fewer exams lower infection risk, especially after the water breaks.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What is intermittent fetal heart monitoring?", "response": "It’s periodic listening to the baby’s heartbeat at set intervals, often used in low-risk labor. It avoids continuous monitors and still checks well-being regularly.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "Is continuous monitoring always better?", "response": "Not necessarily. In low-risk births, intermittent listening can be a safe option and reduces restrictions on movement. Your team chooses monitoring based on your needs.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "How is my baby’s position checked?", "response": "Your clinician may use hands-on belly exam (Leopold maneuvers) and ultrasound if needed. This helps assess lie, presentation, and position to guide care.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What is rupture of membranes?", "response": "It’s when the amniotic sac breaks and fluid leaks. Note the time and color of fluid. Avoid putting anything in the vagina and contact your clinician for guidance.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "How do clinicians confirm my water broke?", "response": "They may use a speculum exam to look for pooling, check pH/microscopy, or use lab tests for amniotic proteins. This helps guide next steps safely.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What are signs the placenta is separating?", "response": "A gush of blood, the cord lengthening, and the uterus feeling firmer and higher. The placenta often delivers within 5–30 minutes after the baby.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "How is bleeding managed after birth?", "response": "Your team watches closely and may use uterine massage and a medication like oxytocin to reduce hemorrhage risk. Tell your team if you feel dizzy or unwell. If you’re concerned, contact your clinician or go to Labor & Delivery.", "risk": "high"}
{"prompt": "What is delayed cord clamping?", "response": "Waiting a short time before clamping the cord lets more blood pass to the baby, improving iron stores. Your team will balance benefits and any risks in your situation.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "Are there times to avoid delayed cord clamping?", "response": "Yes, certain emergencies or specific twin types can change the plan. Your team will advise what’s safest for you and your baby.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What pain relief options do I have?", "response": "Choices include movement, water, breathing, massage, nitrous oxide, IV medicines, and epidural. Ask what’s available and right for you.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "Can water help with labor pain?", "response": "Warm showers or water immersion can ease discomfort for some people in early/active labor. Staff monitor water temperature and safety.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What is a ‘peanut ball’?", "response": "It’s a peanut-shaped birth ball sometimes used in bed to help open the pelvis and improve comfort. Evidence on speeding labor is mixed, but many find it helpful.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "How can I protect my perineum during birth?", "response": "Warm compresses, slow controlled pushing, and hands-on support from your clinician may help. Episiotomy isn’t routine and is used selectively.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "Should I push right away at 10 cm?", "response": "Some push immediately; others wait for a strong urge or more descent. Both approaches can be reasonable—your team will tailor this with you.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What’s the best pushing technique?", "response": "Many prefer to follow their body’s urges if no epidural. With an epidural, your team can coach you. The best approach is the one that’s effective and comfortable for you.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "Does an epidural slow labor?", "response": "Epidurals can lengthen some parts of labor for some people, but they provide strong pain relief. Your team balances comfort with progress and safety.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "Can I choose birth positions in the second stage?", "response": "Yes, positions that allow sacral movement—like upright or hands-and-knees—may shorten pushing and improve comfort. Your team supports safe choices.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What are warning signs during labor?", "response": "Heavy bleeding, fever, severe constant pain, chest pain, severe headache or vision changes, decreased fetal movement, or foul-smelling fluid. Seek care urgently if these occur.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "How do I make a birth plan?", "response": "List your preferences for support people, monitoring, positions, pain relief, and newborn care. Keep it flexible—your team will help adjust if needs change.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "How can I stay calm during labor?", "response": "Practice breathing, visualization, and rhythm (like swaying). Keep lights and sounds comfortable and lean on your support person or doula.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What is Group B Strep (GBS) and why does it matter in labor?", "response": "GBS is a common bacteria. If you test positive or have certain risks, antibiotics in labor lower the chance of newborn infection. Your team will guide timing.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "Can I drink clear liquids in labor?", "response": "Often yes in low-risk labor, but hospital policies vary. Ask your team what’s safe for you, especially if a procedure becomes likely.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "How often will my baby’s heart rate be checked if I’m low risk?", "response": "If intermittent listening is used, it’s typically checked at set intervals in active labor and more often during pushing. Your team explains the schedule.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "Can frequent vaginal exams increase infection risk?", "response": "Yes, especially after the water breaks. That’s why exams are spaced out unless there’s a clinical reason to check more often.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What can slow labor progress?", "response": "Factors include baby’s position, tiredness, dehydration, or irregular contractions. Position changes, rest, fluids, and support can help.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "When is an amniotomy (breaking water) used?", "response": "It may be considered to assess labor progress or monitoring needs, but it isn’t routine for everyone. Your team weighs benefits and risks for you.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What if my labor ‘stalls’?", "response": "Your team reassesses hydration, positioning, rest, and contractions. Sometimes augmentation is considered. Plans are individualized for safety.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What are common second-stage (pushing) time ranges?", "response": "Pushing time varies widely by history, position, and anesthesia. Your team balances patience with safety and checks progress regularly. If anything feels off or worsens, contact your clinician.", "risk": "medium"}
{"prompt": "Can I choose who is with me in labor?", "response": "Usually yes, within facility rules. Support people can comfort you, advocate for your preferences, and help you focus.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What is continuous labor support?", "response": "Having someone with you continuously—a partner, doula, or nurse—can reduce anxiety, improve coping, and support your preferences.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "Is ‘laboring down’ an option?", "response": "Some choose to wait for a strong urge to push after 10 cm to allow more descent. It can reduce active pushing time for some. Your team will individualize this.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "How do I know if the baby is tolerating labor?", "response": "The team watches heart rate patterns and your progress. They’ll explain findings and next steps if anything looks concerning.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What if the baby passes meconium before birth?", "response": "Green or brown fluid suggests meconium. Your team monitors closely and plans newborn support at birth as needed.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What is postpartum hemorrhage and how is it prevented?", "response": "It’s heavy bleeding after birth. Preventive steps include uterine massage and a medication like oxytocin. The team watches closely and treats early if needed.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What happens right after the placenta is out?", "response": "You’ll be monitored, baby will be assessed, and early feeding and skin-to-skin are encouraged if stable. The team watches your bleeding and vital signs.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "Is skin-to-skin after birth important?", "response": "Yes. It helps with bonding, temperature regulation, and early feeding cues. If either of you needs care, it can resume when safe.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What are normal emotions during labor?", "response": "It’s common to feel waves of focus, doubt, excitement, or exhaustion. Support, calm cues, and reassurance help you ride those waves.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "How can my partner help during labor?", "response": "Offer steady presence, comfort measures, hydration reminders, and help with position changes. Ask staff how to best support each step.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What if I’m induced—does this change labor stages?", "response": "The stages are the same, but timing can differ. The team monitors closely and explains the plan for medications or procedures used.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What if I’m far from the hospital?", "response": "Leave earlier once you have a consistent pattern or per your plan. Keep essentials ready and call your clinician if symptoms escalate.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What are common complications to watch for during labor?", "response": "Concerns include infection, hemorrhage, very slow progress, and fetal distress. Your team watches for early signs and acts quickly if needed.", "risk": "low"}

{"prompt": "How can I involve my support person in monitoring?", "response": "Teach them the signs, ask for help with timing contractions and hydration, and have them keep emergency contacts handy.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "When will I go into labor?", "response": "Most pregnancies last about 40 weeks, but there’s no exact way to predict the day. Many people give birth between 38 and 41 weeks. Knowing what to expect helps you feel prepared when labor begins.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What causes labor to start?", "response": "The exact trigger isn’t known. Hormonal changes likely play a role. Many people can tell when labor begins, but sometimes it’s hard to pinpoint the start.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What happens to the body when labor begins?", "response": "The cervix opens (dilates) and thins (effaces). Uterine muscles contract regularly, making your belly firm during contractions and soft between them.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What changes should I watch for before labor?", "response": "Common signs include lightening (baby dropping), loss of the mucus plug, rupture of membranes (water breaking), and regular contractions. You might notice some or all of these.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What is lightening?", "response": "Lightening is when the baby drops lower into your pelvis. Breathing may feel easier, but pelvic pressure can increase. It can happen weeks or hours before labor.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What does losing the mucus plug mean?", "response": "As the cervix opens, a thick mucus plug can pass into the vagina. You may see clear, pink, or slightly bloody discharge. Labor may be soon, but timing varies.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What is rupture of membranes?", "response": "It’s the breaking of the amniotic sac—your water breaking. You may feel a trickle or gush of fluid. Call your provider and follow their instructions.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What do labor contractions feel like?", "response": "They often feel like strong menstrual cramps or pressure in your back or pelvis. True labor contractions form a regular pattern and get closer together over time.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What are Braxton Hicks contractions?", "response": "They’re ‘practice’ contractions that can occur for weeks before labor. They are often irregular and may be uncomfortable, especially later in the day. If anything feels off or worsens, contact your clinician.", "risk": "medium"}
{"prompt": "How do I tell false labor from true labor?", "response": "False labor contractions are irregular, may stop with rest or water, and don’t get stronger. True labor contractions become regular, closer together, and stronger over time.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What is the timing difference between true and false labor?", "response": "True labor shows a regular pattern that gets closer together. False labor doesn’t follow a pattern and stays irregular. If anything feels off or worsens, contact your clinician.", "risk": "medium"}
{"prompt": "Do contractions change with movement in true labor?", "response": "True labor contractions continue despite rest or movement. False labor often eases with walking, resting, or changing positions.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "How does contraction strength differ in true vs false labor?", "response": "True labor contractions steadily increase in strength. False labor contractions remain mild or may start strong and then fade.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "Where is pain felt in true labor vs false labor?", "response": "True labor pain often starts in the back and moves to the front. False labor is more likely felt only in the front.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "When should I call my provider or go to the hospital?", "response": "Call if you think you’re in labor or aren’t sure. Go in for water breaking without contractions, heavy vaginal bleeding, constant severe pain, or decreased fetal movement.", "risk": "low"}

{"prompt": "How long does labor last if I’ve given birth before?", "response": "Subsequent labors often last 8–10 hours, but timing varies. Your experience can differ from previous births.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What should I discuss with my care team before my due date?", "response": "Ask when to call, how to reach the team after hours, whether to call first or go directly in, and what steps to take if you think labor has started.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "How should I plan my trip to the hospital?", "response": "Know your route and travel time, consider traffic or rush hour, and practice the drive so you’re confident about timing.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What should I do before labor begins?", "response": "Pack a hospital bag, plan care for children/pets/home, install and check your car seat, and arrange work coverage in advance. If anything feels off or worsens, contact your clinician.", "risk": "medium"}
{"prompt": "What’s included in a simple labor prep checklist?", "response": "Hospital route, packed bag, car seat installed, childcare/pet plan, work coverage, and clear contact info for your provider.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "Should I track contractions at home?", "response": "Yes. Track how far apart they are and how long they last. A regular pattern that gets closer and stronger suggests true labor.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What’s a practical rule for going in during labor?", "response": "Many use the 5-1-1 guide: contractions every 5 minutes, lasting about 1 minute each, for about 1 hour. If unsure, call your provider.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "Do all labors start with water breaking?", "response": "No. Many labors begin with contractions; some waters don’t break until active labor or even during delivery.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What should I do if my water breaks first?", "response": "Call your provider right away and follow instructions. Note the time and fluid color/odor, and avoid putting anything in the vagina. If anything feels off or worsens, contact your clinician.", "risk": "medium"}
{"prompt": "Is light spotting normal when labor is near?", "response": "A small amount of pink or blood-streaked mucus (bloody show) can be normal. Heavy or bright-red bleeding needs urgent evaluation.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "Can I ignore irregular contractions?", "response": "Monitor them. If they become regular, closer, and stronger—or you’re unsure—call your provider for guidance.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "Why do contractions make my abdomen hard?", "response": "The uterus is a muscle. When it contracts, it firms up; between contractions it relaxes and softens.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "Can Braxton Hicks be painful?", "response": "They can be uncomfortable or even painful, especially later in pregnancy, but they’re typically irregular and ease with rest or hydration. If anything feels off or worsens, contact your clinician.", "risk": "medium"}
{"prompt": "Do false labor contractions change the cervix?", "response": "No. False labor doesn’t cause progressive dilation and effacement. True labor does.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What if rest and water don’t stop my contractions?", "response": "If contractions continue or intensify despite rest and hydration—especially on a regular pattern—contact your provider.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What if my contractions are painful but far apart?", "response": "That may be early labor. Rest, hydrate, and keep tracking. If they become closer and stronger, call your provider or follow your plan.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What if contractions get closer but aren’t very strong?", "response": "Patterns vary. If you’re unsure, call your provider. They may guide you on when to come in for evaluation.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "Does back pain always mean labor?", "response": "Not always. But rhythmic back pain that comes in waves can be a sign of contractions. Track the pattern and call if concerned.", "risk": "low"}

{"prompt": "If my water breaks but I’m not contracting, what then?", "response": "Call your provider. They may ask you to come in for evaluation and monitoring, even without contractions.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "Do I need to call first or go straight to the hospital?", "response": "Follow your care team’s plan. Many recommend calling first if it’s not an emergency. For emergencies, go in immediately.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What are the first physical signs that labor is beginning?", "response": "Regular, intensifying contractions; possible bloody show; water breaking; and a sense that the baby has dropped lower (lightening).", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "Does everyone notice lightening?", "response": "Not always. Some people feel lighter breathing or more pelvic pressure; others don’t notice a clear change before labor.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "Can the mucus plug come out in pieces?", "response": "Yes. Some pass a small amount at a time; others see one larger clump. Color can be clear, pink, or slightly bloody.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "Does losing the mucus plug mean labor is immediate?", "response": "Not necessarily. Labor could be hours, days, or even weeks away. Watch other signs and stay in touch with your provider.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What does true labor timing look like?", "response": "Contractions form a pattern, come at regular intervals, and gradually get closer together and stronger over time. If anything feels off or worsens, contact your clinician.", "risk": "medium"}
{"prompt": "Do true labor contractions stop with rest?", "response": "No. True labor continues despite rest, movement, or hydration, and typically intensifies over time.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "Where do true labor contractions usually start?", "response": "Many feel them in the back moving to the front, but experiences vary. The key is a regular, strengthening pattern.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "Can I be in labor without intense pain?", "response": "Yes. Pain levels vary. Pattern and cervical change define labor more than pain intensity alone.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What if I’m unsure whether it’s labor?", "response": "Time the contractions, hydrate, rest, and call your provider. They may advise coming in for a cervical check.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "How do I prepare my home for a quick departure?", "response": "Keep your bag ready, gas in the car, important documents in one place, and the car seat installed and checked.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What should be in my hospital bag?", "response": "ID/insurance, phone/charger, toiletries, comfy clothes, snacks, newborn outfit/blanket, and any comfort items you prefer.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "Why install the car seat early?", "response": "Proper installation can take time and practice. Having it ready avoids stress when it’s time to go home.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "How do I plan childcare for other kids?", "response": "Arrange backup caregivers, share your hospital plan and contact info, and keep an emergency key available if needed.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What about pet care during labor?", "response": "Set up a feeder/walker or trusted friend. Leave clear instructions, food, and vet contact information.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "How do I plan for work coverage?", "response": "Talk with your supervisor about your due window, hand off tasks, and share how to reach your team while you’re out.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "Is it normal to feel nervous as labor nears?", "response": "Yes. Learning the signs, packing early, and having a plan for calling and transport helps reduce anxiety.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "Can I rehearse the hospital trip?", "response": "Yes—doing a practice drive at likely traffic times helps you plan realistic timing and routes.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "Should I avoid heavy meals late in labor?", "response": "Many prefer light snacks and clear fluids. Follow your provider’s guidance and facility policies.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "Why do some people feel contractions more at night?", "response": "Hormonal patterns, daily fatigue, and fewer distractions can make sensations more noticeable in the evening.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "Can labor start and then pause?", "response": "Yes. Early labor can wax and wane. Rest, hydrate, and track contractions. Call your provider if unsure.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "How do I know it’s time to push?", "response": "Pushing usually starts at full dilation (10 cm) and a strong urge to bear down. Your team confirms when it’s safe. If anything feels off or worsens, contact your clinician.", "risk": "medium"}
{"prompt": "What if my contractions are strong but irregular?", "response": "This may be early labor. Keep timing them. If they become regular and closer together—or you’re concerned—call your provider.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "Should I change positions during early labor?", "response": "Yes. Gentle movement or side-lying can help comfort and progress. Choose what feels best and safe for you.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "Why does my belly get tight then soft during labor?", "response": "That’s your uterus working—tight during a contraction, soft between contractions as it relaxes.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "Can dehydration make contractions feel worse?", "response": "Yes. Dehydration can increase uterine irritability. Sip fluids regularly and rest.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "Is it okay to shower during early labor?", "response": "A warm shower can soothe discomfort. Stop if you feel dizzy or unwell, and follow your provider’s guidance.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "Do I have to wait for the 5-1-1 rule exactly?", "response": "No. Use it as a guide. If you’re in significant pain, have concerns, or live far from the hospital, call earlier. If anything feels off or worsens, contact your clinician.", "risk": "medium"}
{"prompt": "What should I do if I have a sudden gush of fluid?", "response": "Note the time, color, and odor; put on a pad; and contact your provider promptly for instructions. If anything feels off or worsens, contact your clinician.", "risk": "medium"}
{"prompt": "What if fluid keeps leaking slowly?", "response": "Ongoing leakage can still mean your water broke. Call your provider to discuss an evaluation.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "Is a blood-tinged mucus discharge normal near labor?", "response": "A small amount can be normal (bloody show). Heavy or bright-red bleeding is not—seek urgent care.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "Can back-only pain be labor?", "response": "Yes. Some feel ‘back labor.’ If it’s rhythmic and builds in a pattern, call your provider.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "How do I track contractions accurately?", "response": "Time from the start of one contraction to the start of the next for frequency, and measure each contraction’s duration. Use a timer or an app.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What if contractions stop after resting for a while?", "response": "That’s common in early or false labor. If they return and become regular and stronger, call your provider.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "Could I miss the start of labor?", "response": "Most people notice a change in pattern or intensity. If you’re unsure, tracking and a phone call to your provider can help clarify.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "Do I need to call if my water breaks but I feel fine?", "response": "Yes. Even if you feel well, water breaking needs timely evaluation to reduce infection risks.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "How can my support person help at home?", "response": "They can time contractions, encourage fluids and rest, offer comfort, prep the bag and car, and call the provider if needed.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What if I feel less pain but contractions stay regular?", "response": "Pain can vary. A regular, strengthening pattern matters most. If unsure, call your provider for guidance.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What are the biggest red flags before or during labor?", "response": "Heavy bleeding, constant severe pain, fever, water breaking with discoloration or odor, or decreased fetal movement—seek prompt care.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "Will my labor be like my family members’ labors?", "response": "Not necessarily. Each labor is unique, even for the same person across different pregnancies.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "Is there anything else I should do before labor starts?", "response": "Review your birth preferences with your team, confirm contacts and after-hours steps, and keep a flexible mindset for safety.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "Does everyone feel the mucus plug come out?", "response": "No. Some don’t notice it at all, and that’s okay. Focus on overall patterns and other labor signs.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "Can true labor start with mild, regular cramps?", "response": "Yes. True labor can begin mildly but builds over time in strength and frequency, and leads to cervical change. If anything feels off or worsens, contact your clinician.", "risk": "medium"}
{"prompt": "Should I avoid vaginal exams at home if I think labor started?", "response": "Yes. Don’t insert anything into the vagina. Call your provider for instructions and go in if advised.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What’s the simplest plan if I’m unsure about labor?", "response": "Hydrate, rest, track for an hour, and call your provider. If red flags appear, go to labor and delivery promptly.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "Why is pregnancy counted as 40 weeks if the baby is in the womb about 38 weeks?", "response": "Gestational age starts from the first day of your last menstrual period, not conception. Conception typically occurs about 2 weeks later, which is why pregnancy is counted as 40 weeks.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "What are the three trimesters of pregnancy?", "response": "First trimester: conception to 12 weeks. Second trimester: 13–27 weeks. Third trimester: 28–40 weeks.", "risk": "low"}
{"prompt": "When is a baby considered full term?", "response": "Babies are considered full term when born between 37 and 42 weeks of pregnancy.", "risk": "low"}
